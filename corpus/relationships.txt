“When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable.”




“I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together.”



“Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.”



“I think you still love me, but we can’t escape the fact that I’m not enough for you. I knew this was going to happen. So I’m not blaming you for falling in love with another woman. I’m not angry, either. I should be, but I’m not. I just feel pain. A lot of pain. I thought I could imagine how much this would hurt, but I was wrong.”



“The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.”

“A guy and a girl can be just friends, but at one point or another, they will fall for each other...Maybe temporarily, maybe at the wrong time, maybe too late, or maybe forever”

“You can talk with someone for years, everyday, and still, it won't mean as much as what you can have when you sit in front of someone, not saying a word, yet you feel that person with your heart, you feel like you have known the person for forever.... connections are made with the heart, not the tongue.”

“For the two of us, home isn't a place. It is a person. And we are finally home.”



“Man may have discovered fire, but women discovered how to play with it.”



“It hurts to let go. Sometimes it seems the harder you try to hold on to something or someone the more it wants to get away. You feel like some kind of criminal for having felt, for having wanted. For having wanted to be wanted. It confuses you, because you think that your feelings were wrong and it makes you feel so small because it's so hard to keep it inside when you let it out and it doesn't coma back. You're left so alone that you can't explain. Damn, there's nothing like that, is there? I've been there and you have too. You're nodding your head.”



“We’re all seeking that special person who is right for us. But if you’ve been through enough relationships, you begin to suspect there’s no right person, just different flavors of wrong. Why is this? Because you yourself are wrong in some way, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. But it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. And it isn’t until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problems—the ones that make you truly who you are—that we’re ready to find a lifelong mate. Only then do you finally know what you’re looking for. You’re looking for the wrong person. But not just any wrong person: it's got to be the right wrong person—someone you lovingly gaze upon and think, “This is the problem I want to have.”
I will find that special person who is wrong for me in just the right way.”



“The most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much, and forgetting that you are special too.”



“Well, it seems to me that the best relationships - the ones that last - are frequently the ones that are rooted in friendship. You know, one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before. Like a switch has been flicked somewhere. And the person who was just a friend is... suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with.”

“Why is it," he said, one time, at the subway entrance, "I feel I've known you so many years?"
"Because I like you," she said, "and I don't want anything from you.”



“I mean, if the relationship can't survive the long term, why on earth would it be worth my time and energy for the short term?”



“When you stop expecting people to be perfect, you can like them for who they are.”



“Every man I meet wants to protect me. I can't figure out what from.”

“There is greatness in doing something you hate for the sake of someone you love.”

“If conversation was the lyrics, laughter was the music, making time spent together a melody that could be replayed over and over without getting stale.”

“I know I am but summer to your heart, and not the full four seasons of the year.”

“Come sleep with me: We won't make Love, Love will make us.”

“It's no good pretending that any relationship has a future if your record collections disagree violently or if your favorite films wouldn't even speak to each other if they met at a party.”

“Therefore, dear Sir, love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes you. For those who are near you are far away... and this shows that the space around you is beginning to grow vast.... be happy about your growth, in which of course you can't take anyone with you, and be gentle with those who stay behind; be confident and calm in front of them and don't torment them with your doubts and don't frighten them with your faith or joy, which they wouldn't be able to comprehend. Seek out some simple and true feeling of what you have in common with them, which doesn't necessarily have to alter when you yourself change again and again; when you see them, love life in a form that is not your own and be indulgent toward those who are growing old, who are afraid of the aloneness that you trust.... and don't expect any understanding; but believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it.”



“I will love you always. When this red hair is white, I will still love you. When the smooth softness of youth is replaced by the delicate softness of age, I will still want to touch your skin. When your face is full of the lines of every smile you have ever smiled, of every surprise I have seen flash through your eyes, when every tear you have ever cried has left its mark upon your face,I will treasure you all the more, because I was there to see it all. I will share your life with you, Meredith, and I will love you until the last breath leaves your body or mine.”



“Holding Eleanor's hand was like holding a butterfly. Or a heartbeat. Like holding something complete, and completely alive.”



“When we're incomplete, we're always searching for somebody to complete us. When, after a few years or a few months of a relationship, we find that we're still unfulfilled, we blame our partners and take up with somebody more promising. This can go on and on--series polygamy--until we admit that while a partner can add sweet dimensions to our lives, we, each of us, are responsible for our own fulfillment. Nobody else can provide it for us, and to believe otherwise is to delude ourselves dangerously and to program for eventual failure every relationship we enter.”

“To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhow - this is a human offering that can border on miraculous.”



“Maybe our girlfriends are our soulmates and guys are just people to have fun with.”



“I’ve been fighting to be who I am all my life. What’s the point of being who I am, if I can’t have the person who was worth all the fighting for?”



“I want to be in a relationship where you telling me you love me is just a ceremonious validation of what you already show me.”



“Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired, women, because they are curious: both are disappointed.”




“I suffer from girlnextdooritis where the guy is friends with you and that's it.”

“Man, when you lose your laugh you lose your footing.”



“Every couple needs to argue now and then. Just to prove that the relationship is strong enough to survive. Long-term relationships, the ones that matter, are all about weathering the peaks and the valleys.”



“I know enough to know that no woman should ever marry a man who hated his mother.”



“For there to be betrayal, there would have to have been trust first.”



“Maybe its like you said before, all of us being cracked open. Like each of us starts out as a watertight vessel. And then things happen - these people leave us, or don’t love us, or don’t get us, or we don’t get them, and we lose and fail and hurt one another. And the vessel starts to crack in places. And I mean, yeah once the vessel cracks open, the end becomes inevitable. Once it starts to rain inside the Osprey, it will never be remodeled. But there is all this time between when the cracks start to open up and when we finally fall apart. And its only that time that we see one another, because we see out of ourselves through our cracks and into others through theirs. When did we see each other face to face? Not until you saw into my cracks and I saw into yours. Before that we were just looking at ideas of each other, like looking at your window shade, but never seeing inside. But once the vessel cracks, the light can get in. The light can get out.”



“People like to say love is unconditional, but it's not, and even if it was unconditional, it's still never free. There's always an expectation attached. They always want something in return. Like they want you to be happy or whatever and that makes you automatically responsible for their happiness because they won't be happy unless you are ... I just don't want that responsibility.”



“Usually adult males who are unable to make emotional connections with the women they choose to be intimate with are frozen in time, unable to allow themselves to love for fear that the loved one will abandon them. If the first woman they passionately loved, the mother, was not true to her bond of love, then how can they trust that their partner will be true to love. Often in their adult relationships these men act out again and again to test their partner's love. While the rejected adolescent boy imagines that he can no longer receive his mother's love because he is not worthy, as a grown man he may act out in ways that are unworthy and yet demand of the woman in his life that she offer him unconditional love. This testing does not heal the wound of the past, it merely reenacts it, for ultimately the woman will become weary of being tested and end the relationship, thus reenacting the abandonment. This drama confirms for many men that they cannot put their trust in love. They decide that it is better to put their faith in being powerful, in being dominant.”

“Even though you may want to move forward in your life, you may have one foot on the brakes. In order to be free, we must learn how to let go. Release the hurt. Release the fear. Refuse to entertain your old pain. The energy it takes to hang onto the past is holding you back from a new life. What is it you would let go of today?”

“To say that one waits a lifetime for his soulmate to come around is a paradox. People eventually get sick of waiting, take a chance on someone, and by the art of commitment become soulmates, which takes a lifetime to perfect.”



“Part of the problem with the word 'disabilities' is that it immediately suggests an inability to see or hear or walk or do other things that many of us take for granted. But what of people who can't feel? Or talk about their feelings? Or manage their feelings in constructive ways? What of people who aren't able to form close and strong relationships? And people who cannot find fulfillment in their lives, or those who have lost hope, who live in disappointment and bitterness and find in life no joy, no love? These, it seems to me, are the real disabilities.”



“When you don't talk, there's a lot of stuff that ends up not getting said.”



“Our wounds are often the openings into the best and most beautiful part of us.”

“Cheating and lying aren't struggles, they're reasons to break up.”



“If you spend your time hoping someone will suffer the consequences for what they did to your heart, then you're allowing them to hurt you a second time in your mind.”

“I used to advertise my loyalty and I don't believe there is a single person I loved that I didn't eventually betray.”



“Relationships dont always make sense. Especially from the outside”



“Those sweet lips. My, oh my, I could kiss those lips all night long.
Good things come to those who wait.”



“Lots of things can be fixed. Things can be fixed. But many times, relationships between people cannot be fixed, because they should not be fixed. You're aboard a ship setting sail, and the other person has joined the inland circus, or is boarding a different ship, and you just can't be with each other anymore. Because you shouldn't be.”

“Every couple has ups and downs, every couple argues, and that’s the thing—you’re a couple, and couples can’t function without trust.”



“I may not always be with you
But when we're far apart
Remember you will be with me
Right inside my heart”



“It is an absolute human certainty that no one can know his own beauty or perceive a sense of his own worth until it has been reflected back to him in the mirror of another loving, caring human being.”



“We die to each other daily. What we know of other people is only our memory of the moments during which we knew them. And they have changed since then. To pretend that they and we are the same is a useful and convenient social convention which must sometimes be broken. We must also remember that at every meeting we are meeting a stranger.”



“A dame that knows the ropes isn't likely to get tied up.”

“I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay”

“Relationships are mysterious. We doubt the positive qualities in others, seldom the negative. You will say to your partner: do you really love me? Are you sure you love me? You will ask this a dozen times and drive the person nuts. But you never ask: are you really mad at me? Are you sure you’re angry? When someone is angry, you don’t doubt it for a moment. Yet the reverse should be true. We should doubt the negative in life, and have faith in the positive.”



“If a girl starts out all casual with a guy and she doesn't tell him that she wants a relationship, it will never become a relationship. If you give the guy the impression that casual is okay with you, that's all he'll ever want. Be straight with him from the start. If he gets scared and runs away, he wasn't right for you.”



“Forgive the past. It is over. Learn from it and let go. People are constantly changing and growing. Do not cling to a limited, disconnected, negative image of a person in the past. See that person now. Your relationship is always alive and changing.”



“Women cannot complain about men anymore until they start getting better taste in them.”

“I was suffering the easily foreseeable consequences. Addiction is the hallmark of every infatuation-based love story. It all begins when the object of your adoration bestows upon you a heady, hallucinogenic dose of something you never dared to admit you wanted-an emotional speedball, perhaps, of thunderous love and roiling excitement. Soon you start craving that intense attention, with a hungry obsession of any junkie. When the drug is witheld, you promptly turn sick, crazy, and depleted (not to mention resentful of the dealer who encouraged this addiction in the first place but now refuses to pony up the good stuff anymore-- despite the fact that you know he has it hidden somewhere, goddamn it, because he used to give it to you for free). Next stage finds you skinny and shaking in a corner, certain only that you would sell your soul or rob your neighbors just to have 'that thing' even one more time. Meanwhile, the object of your adoration has now become repulsed by you. He looks at you like you're someone he's never met before, much less someone he once loved with high passion. The irony is,you can hardly blame him. I mean, check yourself out. You're a pathetic mess,unrecognizable even to your own eyes. So that's it. You have now reached infatuation's final destination-- the complete and merciless devaluation of self." - pg 20-21”

“What we wait around a lifetime for with one person, we can find in a moment with someone else.”




“Of course it hurt that we could never love each other in a physical way. We would have been far more happy if we had. But that was like the tides, the change of seasons--something immutable, an immovable destiny we could never alter. No matter how cleverly we might shelter it, our delicate friendship wasn't going to last forever. We were bound to reach a dead end. That was painfully clear.”



“I think you are wrong to want a heart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in luck not to have a heart.”



“nothing in this world was more difficult than love.”

“Books are a poor substitute for female companionship, but they are easier to find.”



“I care," he said in a trembling voice. "I care so much that I do not know how to tell you without it seeming inconsequential compared to how I feel. Even if I am distant at times and seem as if I do not want to be with you, it is only because this scares me, too.”



“Every woman that finally figured out her worth, has picked up her suitcases of pride and boarded a flight to freedom, which landed in the valley of change.”

“Don't leave a piece of jewelry at his house so you can go back and get it later; he may be with his real girlfriend.”



“Because I can't help doing it," he said with a shrug. "And hey, if I keep loving you, maybe you'll eventually crack and love me too. Hell, I'm pretty sure you're already half in love with me."
"I am not! And everything you just said is ridiculous. That's terrible logic."
Adrian returned to his crossword puzzle. "Well, you can think what you want, so long as you remember-no matter how ordinary things seem between us-I'm still here, still in love with you, and care about you more than any other guy, evil or otherwise, ever will."
"I don't think you're evil."
"See? Things are already looking promising.”



“Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised or a little mistaken.”



“I find the best way to love someone is not to change them, but instead, help them reveal the greatest version of themselves.”



“All I'm telling you to do is to be smart about it. Know that if this man isn't looking for a serious relationship, you're not going to change his mind just because you two are going on dates and being intimate. You could be the most perfect woman on the Lord's green earth-you're capable of interesting conversation, you cook a mean breakfast, you hand out backrubs like sandwiches, you're independent (which means, to him, that you're not going to be in his pockets)-but if he's not ready for a serious relationship, he going to treat you like sports fish.”



“There comes a time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page, write another book or simply close it.”

“You’re just another story I can’t tell anymore.”



“We kiss all the time." I clear my throat, then add, "We just...do it in private."
"A smug expression crosses his face. "I don't buy it for a second, 'cause if you were my girlfriend and a stud like me was livin' in your house, I'd kiss you in front of the guy every chance I got as a reminder."
"A reminder of w-w-what?"
"That you were mine.”



“A fit, healthy body—that is the best fashion statement”

“Moving on is easy. It's staying moved on that's trickier.”

“Sometimes it takes a heartbreak to shake us awake & help us see we are worth so much more than we're settling for.”



“He could totally be your boyfriend," [Angel] went on with annoying persistance. "You guys could get married. I could be like a junior bridesmaid. Total could be your flower dog."
"I'm only a kid!" I shrieked. "I can't get married!"
"You could in New Hampshire."
My mouth dropped open. How does she know this stuff? "Forget it! No one's getting married!" I hissed. "Not in New Hampshire or anywhere else! Not in a box, not with a fox! Now go to sleep,
before I kill you!
”



“How would your life be different if…You walked away from gossip and verbal defamation? Let today be the day…You speak only the good you know of other people and encourage others to do the same.”



“We have to recognise that there cannot be relationships unless there is commitment, unless there is loyalty, unless there is love, patience, persistence.”



“Assumptions are the termites of relationships.”

“We die containing a richness of lovers and tribes, tastes we have swallowed, bodies we have plunged into and swum up as if rivers of wisdom, characters we have climbed into as if trees, fears we have hidden in as if caves.
I wish for all this to be marked on by body when I am dead. I believe in such cartography - to be marked by nature, not just to label ourselves on a map like the names of rich men and women on buildings. We are communal histories, communal books. We are not owned or monogamous in our taste or experience.”



“only someone who is ready for everything, who doesn't exclude any experience, even the most incomprehensible, will live the relationship with another person as something alive and will himself sound the depths of his own being.”



“When we face pain in relationships our first response is often to sever bonds rather than to maintain commitment.
”



“You couldn't just pick and choose at will when someone depended on you, or loved you. It wasn't like a light switch, easy to turn on or off. If you were in, you were in. Out, you were out.”



“I felt like an animal, and animals don’t know sin, do they?”



“If you need something from somebody always give that person a way to hand it to you.”



“You can measure the happiness of a marriage by the number of scars that each partner carries on their tongues, earned from years of biting back angry words.”



“When dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic, but with creatures bristling with prejudice and motivated by pride and vanity.”




“Mocking a woman is like drinking too much wine. It may be fun for a short time, but the hangover is hell.”



“This is what happened in love. One of you cried a lot and then both of you grew sarcastic.”



“It takes three to make love, not two: you, your spouse, and God. Without God people only succeed in bringing out the worst in one another. Lovers who have nothing else to do but love each other soon find there is nothing else. Without a central loyalty life is unfinished.”



“When you loved someone and had to let them go, there will always be that small part of yourself that whispers, "What was it that you wanted and why didn't you fight for it?”

“Do you know what it means to come home at night to a woman who'll give you a little love, a little affection, a little tenderness? It means you're in the wrong house, that's what it means.”

“Most everything you think you know about me is nothing more than memories.”



“When you hold a grudge, you want someone else’s sorrow to reflect your level of hurt but the two rarely meet.”



“That's when I finally got it. I finally understood. It wasn't the thought that counted. It was the actual execution that mattered, the showing up for somebody. The intent behind it wasn't enough. Not for me. Not anymore. It wasn't enough to know that deep down, he loved me. You had to actually say it to somebody, show them you cared. And he just didn't. Not enough.”



“It's probably a bad indicator of your lifestyle when you miss your ex-boyfriend because he's absolutely lethal.”



“I define connection as the energy that exists between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued; when they can give and receive without judgment; and when they derive sustenance and strength from the relationship.”

“People die, I think, but your relationship with them doesn't. It continues and is ever-changing.”



“The best relationships in our lives are the best not because they have been the happiest ones, they are that way because they have stayed strong through the most tormentful of storms.”



“A true gentleman is one that apologizes anyways, even though he has not offended a lady intentionally. He is in a class all of his own because he knows the value of a woman's heart.”

“He knew one of the women well, and had shared his universe with her. They had seen the same mountains, and the same trees, although each of them had seem them differently. She knew his weaknesses, his moments of hatred, of despair. Yet she was there at his side. They shared the same universe.”



“Statistically speaking, there is a 65 percent chance that the love of your life is having an affair. Be very suspicious.”



“V-Day…if you need this one day in a year to show everyone else you truly care for “your loved one” I think it’s quite stupid. I hate this commercialism. It’s all artificial, and has nothing to do with real love.”



“When you find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will stand in front of you when other’s cast stones, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who will hold your hand when your sick, who thinks your pretty without makeup, the one who turns to his friends and say, ‘that’s her’, the one that would bear your rejection because losing you means losing his will to live, who kisses you when you screw up, watches the stars and names one for you and will hold and rock that baby for hours so you can sleep…..you marry him all over again.”

“Failed relationships can be described as so much wasted make-up.”



“There are so many things that demand to be said. Where did you go? Do you ever think about me? You've ruined me. Are you okay? But of course, I can't say any of that.”



“Certainly the most destructive vice if you like, that a person can have. More than pride, which is supposedly the number one of the cardinal sins - is self pity. Self pity is the worst possible emotion anyone can have. And the most destructive. It is, to slightly paraphrase what Wilde said about hatred, and I think actually hatred's a subset of self pity and not the other way around - ' It destroys everything around it, except itself '.
Self pity will destroy relationships, it'll destroy anything that's good, it will fulfill all the prophecies it makes and leave only itself. And it's so simple to imagine that one is hard done by, and that things are unfair, and that one is underappreciated, and that if only one had had a chance at this, only one had had a chance at that, things would have gone better, you would be happier if only this, that one is unlucky. All those things. And some of them may well even be true. But, to pity oneself as a result of them is to do oneself an enormous disservice.
I think it's one of things we find unattractive about the american culture, a culture which I find mostly, extremely attractive, and I like americans and I love being in america. But, just occasionally there will be some example of the absolutely ravening self pity that they are capable of, and you see it in their talk shows. It's an appalling spectacle, and it's so self destructive. I almost once wanted to publish a self help book saying 'How To Be Happy by Stephen Fry : Guaranteed success'. And people buy this huge book and it's all blank pages, and the first page would just say - ' Stop Feeling Sorry For Yourself - And you will be happy '. Use the rest of the book to write down your interesting thoughts and drawings, and that's what the book would be, and it would be true. And it sounds like 'Oh that's so simple', because it's not simple to stop feeling sorry for yourself, it's bloody hard. Because we do feel sorry for ourselves, it's what Genesis is all about.”

“When you struggle with your partner, you are struggling with yourself. Every fault you see in them touches a denied weakness in yourself.”

“Six hundred and forty fish later, the only thing I know is everything you love will die. The first time you meet someone special, you can count on them one day being dead and in the ground.”



“I want to be around people that do things. I don’t want to be around people anymore that judge or talk about what people do. I want to be around people that dream and support and do things.”

“Can officially confirm that the way to a man's heart these days is not through beauty, food, sex, or alluringness of character, but merely the ability to seem not very interested in him.”



“Rejection is an opportunity for your selection.”

“
misgivings

.
Last night, I got up the courage to ask you if you regretted us.
"There are things I miss," you said. "But if I didn't have you, I'd miss more.”



“Love doesn't mean anything if you're not willing to make a commitment, and you have to think not only about what you want, but about what he wants. Not just now, but in the future.”



“You like every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.”



“And then the line was quite but not dead. I almost felt like he was there in my room with me, but in a way it was better, like I was not in my room and he was not in his, but instead we were together in some invisible and tenuous third space that could only be visited on the phone.”



“He loved her for almost everything she was & she decided that was enough to let him stay for a very long time.”

“A busy, vibrant, goal-oriented woman is so much more attractive than a woman who waits around for a man to validate her existence.”




“Through my love for you, I want to express my love for the whole cosmos, the whole of humanity, and all beings. By living with you, I want to learn to love everyone and all species. If I succeed in loving you, I will be able to love everyone and all species on Earth... This is the real message of love.”



“Unrequited love is the infinite curse of a lonely heart.”

“you can take this mouth
this wound you want
but you can't kiss
and make it
better.”



“Lonely people tend, rather, to be lonely because they decline to bear the psychic costs of being around other humans. They are allergic to people. People affect them too strongly.”



“I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.”

“That's why I loved being with you. We could do the simplest things, like toss starfish into the ocean and share a burger and talk and even then I knew that I was fortunate. Because you were the first guy who wasn't constantly trying to impress me. You accepted who you were, but more than that, you accepted me for me. And nothing else mattered-- not my family or your family or anyone else in the world. It was just us.”



“When what you hear and what you see don't match, trust your eyes.”

“Annabeth,” he said hesitantly, “in New Rome, demigods can live their whole lives in peace.”
Her expression turned guarded. “Reyna explained it to me. But, Percy, you belong at Camp Half-Blood. That other life—”
“I know,” Percy said. “But while I was there, I saw so many demigods living without fear: kids going to college, couples getting married and raising families. There’s nothing like that at Camp Half-Blood. I kept thinking about you and me…and maybe someday when this war with the giants is over…”
It was hard to tell in the golden light, but he thought Annabeth was blushing. “Oh,” she said…
“I’m sorry,” he said. “I just…I had to think of that to keep going. To give me hope. Forget I mentioned—”
“No!” she said. “Gods, Percy, that’s so sweet.”



“We all take different paths in life, but no matter where we go, we take a little of each other everyhwere.”

“We ruined each other by being together. We destroyed each other’s dreams.”



“Hope for love, pray for love, wish for love, dream for love…but don’t put your life on hold waiting for love.”



“If you're trapped in the dream of the Other, you're fucked.”

“He wasn't the type for displays of affection, either verbal or not. He was disgusted by couples that made out in the hallways between classes, and got annoyed at even the slightest sappy moments in movies. But I knew he cared about me: he just conveyed it more subtly, as concise with expressing this emotion as he was with everything else. It was in the way he'd put his hand on the small of my back, for instance, or how he'd smile at me when I said something that surprised him. Once I might have wanted more, but I'd come around to his way of thinking in the time we'd been together. And we were together, all the time. So he didn't have to prove how he felt about me. Like so much else, I should just know.”



“I won't telephone him. I'll never telephone him again as long as I live. He'll rot in hell, before I'll call him up. You don't have to give me strength, God; I have it myself. If he wanted me, he could get me. He knows where I am. He knows I'm waiting here. He's so sure of me, so sure. I wonder why they hate you, as soon as they are sure of you.”



“When God knows you're ready for the responsibility of commitment, He'll reveal the right person under the right circumstances.”



“Last night I was seriously considering whether I was a bisexual or not but I don’t think so though I’m not sure if I’d like to be and argh I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, if you like a person, you like the person, not their genitals.”



“Don't worry about hurting me, if that's what you're afraid of. I want to get hurt. At least I´ll feel something for a change.”



“Perfectly Imperfect
We have all heard that no two snowflakes are alike. Each snowflake takes the perfect form for the maximum efficiency and effectiveness for its journey. And while the universal force of gravity gives them a shared destination, the expansive space in the air gives each snowflake the opportunity to take their own path. They are on the same journey, but each takes a different path.
Along this gravity-driven journey, some snowflakes collide and damage each other, some collide and join together, some are influenced by wind... there are so many transitions and changes that take place along the journey of the snowflake. But, no matter what the transition, the snowflake always finds itself perfectly shaped for its journey.
I find parallels in nature to be a beautiful reflection of grand orchestration. One of these parallels is of snowflakes and us. We, too, are all headed in the same direction. We are being driven by a universal force to the same destination. We are all individuals taking different journeys and along our journey, we sometimes bump into each other, we cross paths, we become altered... we take different physical forms. But at all times we too are 100% perfectly imperfect. At every given moment we are absolutely perfect for what is required for our journey. I’m not perfect for your journey and you’re not perfect for my journey, but I’m perfect for my journey and you’re perfect for your journey. We’re heading to the same place, we’re taking different routes, but we’re both exactly perfect the way we are.
Think of what understanding this great orchestration could mean for relationships. Imagine interacting with others knowing that they too each share this parallel with the snowflake. Like you, they are headed to the same place and no matter what they may appear like to you, they have taken the perfect form for their journey. How strong our relationships would be if we could see and respect that we are all perfectly imperfect for our journey.”



“One of the best times for figuring out who you are & what you really want out of life? Right after a break-up.”



“We are not written for one instrument alone; I am not, neither are you.”



“Intimacy is the capacity to be rather weird with someone - and finding that that's ok with them.”

“I cannot have a man who is afraid of everything, I don't have the time to soothe insecurities and fears, I cannot have a man who is standing on a stone by a creek, watching for the fish to swim by and every time he sees a fish he says "Oh look, this fish scares me, I wonder what this fish means, this fish might mean- this, or this fish might mean- that" for God's sake, they are just fish, and they don't mean anything! Such a sad thing, so many fine, strong men standing on top of little stones, pointing at fish all the time! Such a waste! Such a waste of time! I can only have a man who will leap into the water, not minding the damn fish and whatever other little things that scare him. I need to have someone who is braver than me; if I am a pirate, he has to be the pirate Captain, if I am a pirate Captain he has to be the flying dragon.”

“Sometimes I get real lonely sleeping with you.”



“Trust is the fruit of a relationship in which you know you are loved.”

“Trust is the glue of life. It's the most essential ingredient in effective communication. It's the foundational principle that holds all relationships.”

“You know someone's right for you when the things they don't
have
to say are even more important than the things they do.”



“The words ‘I Love You’ kill, and resurrect millions, in less than a second.”



“My girlfriend is sad and quiet and keeps me up all night worrying about her.”



“You fit into me
like a hook into an eye
a fish hook
an open eye”

“I got my heart's desire, and there my troubles began.”




“You Can't Lose Something You Never Had”

“She was a beautiful dreamer. The kind of girl, who kept her head in the clouds, loved above the stars and left regret beneath the earth she walked on.”

“My head’ll explode if I continue with this escapism.”



“I just...I just miss him. And I hate being so alone.”



“That night when you kissed me, I left a poem in your mouth, and you can hear some of the lines every time you breathe out.”

“We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything—what a waste!”



“Love is a commitment that will be tested in the most vulnerable areas of spirituality, a commitment that will force you to make some very difficult choices. It is a commitment that demands that you deal with your lust, your greed, your pride, your power, your desire to control, your temper, your patience, and every area of temptation that the Bible clearly talks about. It demands the quality of commitment that Jesus demonstrates in His relationship to us.”



“The reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer terror.”



“If equal affection cannot be,
Let the more loving one be me.”

“Submission is not about authority and it is not obedience; it is all about relationships of love and respect.”



“If a man, who says he loves you, won’t tell you the details of a private conversation between him and another woman you can be sure he is not protecting your heart. He is protecting himself and the women he has feelings for. Wise women simply see things as they are, not as their low self-esteem allows.”

“Wanting him to come back before anyone notices part of the world has not moved since he left.”

“Most men claim to desire driven, independent and confident women. Yet when confronted with such a creature reverence often evolves into resent. For just like women, men need to be needed.”

“An unarticulated crush is very different from an unrequited one, because at least with an unrequited crush you know what the hell you're doing, even if the other person isn't doing it back. An unarticulated crush is harder to grapple with, because it's a crush that you haven't even admitted to yourself. The romantic forces are all there -- you want to see him, you always notice him, you treat every word from him as if it weighs more than anyone else's. But you don't know why. You don't know that you're doing it. You'd follow him to the end of the earth without ever admitting that your feet were moving.”



“It’s hard to communicate anything exactly and that’s why perfect relationships between people are difficult to find.”



“Oh, you know. Jace reminds me of an old boyfriend. Some guys look at you like they want sex. Jace looks at you like you've already
had
sex, it was great, and now you're just friends--even though you want more. Drives girls crazy. You know what I mean?"
Yes,
Clary thought. "No," she said.
pg. 280”



“It's not your job to like me - it's mine”

“If I never see you again
I will always carry you
inside
outside
on my fingertips
and at brain edges
and in centers
centers
of what I am of
what remains.”



“We know from daily life that we exist for other people first of all, for whose smiles and well-being our own happiness depends.”

“Have you ever noticed how parents can go from the most wonderful people in the world to totally embarrassing in three seconds?”



“How could I be sleeping with this particular man.... Surely only true love could justify my lack of taste.”



“I would rather a romantic relationship turn into contempt than turn into apathy. The passion in the extremities make it appear as though it once meant something. We grow from hot or cold, but lukewarm is the biggest insult.”



“Someone real," I hear myself saying. "Someone who never has to pretend, and who I never have to pretend around. Someone who's smart, but knows how to laugh at himself. Someone who would listen to a symphony and start to cry, because he understands music can be too big for words. Someone who knows me better than I know myself. Someone I want to talk to first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Someone I feel like I've known my whole life, even if I haven't.”



“And now you are and I am and we're a mystery which will never happen again.”

“Because isn’t that the point of every relationship: to be known by someone else, to be understood? He gets me. She gets me. Isn’t that the simple magic phrase?”



“Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'mma be ok”

“Love.
Not the kind you see in the movies or hear about on the radio.
The real kind.
The kind that gets beaten down and bloody, yet perseveres.
The kind that hopes even when hope seems foolish.
The kind that can forgive. The kind that believes in healing.
The kind that can sit in silence and feel renewed.
The real kind of love.
It's rare and we have it...”



“It's just the most amazing thing to love a dog, isn't it? It makes our relationships with people seem as boring as a bowl of oatmeal.”



“You know that when I hate you, it is because I love you to a point of passion that unhinges my soul.”

“I love you. I hate you. I like you. I hate you. I love you. I think you’re stupid. I think you’re a loser. I think you’re wonderful. I want to be with you. I don’t want to be with you. I would never date you. I hate you. I love you…..I think the madness started the moment we met and you shook my hand. Did you have a disease or something?”

“She was the third beer. Not the first one, which the throat receives with almost tearful gratitude; nor the second, that confirms and extends the pleasure of the first. But the third, the one you drink because it's there, because it can't hurt, and because what difference does it make?”




“I suppose that since most of our hurts come through relationships so will our healing, and I know that grace rarely makes sense for those looking in from the outside.”



“Sometimes the one who is running from the Life/Death/Life nature insists on thinking of love as a boon only. Yet love in its fullest form is a series of deaths and rebirths. We let go of one phase, one aspect of love, and enter another. Passion dies and is brought back. Pain is chased away and surfaces another time. To love means to embrace and at the same time to withstand many endings, and many many beginnings- all in the same relationship.”



“Physical love is unthinkable without violence.”



“I believe in love the verb, not the noun.”



“I'm not crying because of you; you're not worth it. I'm crying because my delusion of who you were was shattered by the truth of who you are.”



“To wisely live your life, you don't need to know much
Just remember two main rules for the beginning:
You better starve, than eat whatever
And better be alone, than with whoever.”



“That's the power of literature, you know, it can act like little love letters between two people who can only explain their feelings by pointing at other people's.”



“Learn to deal with the fact that you are not a perfect person but you are a person that deserves respect and honesty.”



“Because introverts are typically good listeners and, at least, have the appearance of calmness, we are attractive to emotionally needy people. Introverts, gratified that other people are initiating with them, can easily get caught in these exhausting and unsatisfying relationships.”

“A man is lucky if he is the first love of a woman. A woman is lucky if she is the last love of a man.”

“Yes, it's a well-known fact about you: you're like death, you take everything.”



“
Frida Kahlo to Marty McConnell
leaving is not enough; you must
stay gone. train your heart
like a dog. change the locks
even on the house he’s never
visited. you lucky, lucky girl.
you have an apartment
just your size. a bathtub
full of tea. a heart the size
of Arizona, but not nearly

at the market was so compelling you just
had to have them. you had to have him.
and you did. and now you pull down
the bridge between your houses,
you make him call before
he visits, you take a lover
for granted, you take
a lover who looks at you
like maybe you are magic. make
the first bottle you consume
in this place a relic. place it
on whatever altar you fashion

“Love cannot live where there is no trust.”



“I believe in the immeasurable power of love; that true love can endure any circumstance and reach across any distance.”



“But why, why, why can't people just say what they mean?”



“Mutual caring relationships require kindness and patience, tolerance, optimism, joy in the other's achievements, confidence in oneself, and the ability to give without undue thought of gain.”



“The quickest way to rectify that mistake (choosing the wrong person) is by learning from that, moving on, and choosing much more wisely in the future.”



“You think that holding someone hard will bring them closer. You think that you can hold them so hard that you'll still feel them, embossed on you, when you pull away.
Every time Eleanor pulled away from Park, she felt the gasping loss of him.”



“What you want most you push away from you.
You want more than you care to admit.”



“Some people come into our lives and leave footprints on our hearts and we are never ever the same.”

“Love without sacrifice is like theft”



“They lay silently. She was staring at something across the room. She was making him feel uncomfortable. 'It wouldn't work. It's the attraction of opposites,' he said.
We're not opposites.'
I don't mean just you and me. Women fall in love when they get to know you. Men are just the opposite. When they finally know you they're ready to leave.”

“the wounded child inside many males is a boy who, when he first spoke his truths, was silenced by paternal sadism, by a patriarchal world that did not want him to claim his true feelings. The wounded child inside many females is a girl who was taught from early childhood that she must become something other than herself, deny her true feelings, in order to attract and please others. When men and women punish each other for truth telling, we reinforce the notion that lies are better. To be loving we willingly hear the other’s truth, and most important, we affirm the value of truth telling. Lies may make people feel better, but they do not help them to know love.”



“Right now we are here, and nothing can mar our perfection, or steal the joy of this perfect moment.”



“I suppose it’s not a social norm, and not a manly thing to do — to feel, discuss feelings. So that’s what I’m giving the finger to. Social norms and stuff…what good are social norms, really? I think all they do is project a limited and harmful image of people. It thus impedes a broader social acceptance of what someone, or a group of people, might actually be like.”



“Often men who have been emotionally neglected and abused as children by dominating mothers bond with assertive women, only to have their childhood feelings of being engulfed surface. While they could not 'smash their mommy' and still receive love, they find that they can engage in intimate violence with partners who respond to their acting out by trying harder to connect with them emotionally, hoping that the love offered in the present will heal the wounds of the past. If only one party in the relationship is working to create love, to create the space of emotional connection, the dominator model remains in place and the relationship just becomes a site for continuous power struggle.”

“Making love to me is amazing. Wait, I meant: making love, to me, is amazing. The absence of two little commas nearly transformed me into a sex god. ”



“...the opposite of love is not hate -- it's apathy. It's not giving a damn. If somebody hates me, they must "feel" something ... or they couldn't possibly hate. Therefore, there's some way in which I can get to them.”

“No matter how close we are to another person, few human relationships are as free from strife, disagreement, and frustration as is the relationship you have with a good dog. Few human beings give of themselves to another as a dog gives of itself. I also suspect that we cherish dogs because their unblemished souls make us wish - consciously or unconsciously - that we were as innocent as they are, and make us yearn for a place where innocence is universal and where the meanness, the betrayals, and the cruelties of this world are unknown.”




“This love of which I speak is slow to lose patience - it looks for a way of being constructive.
Love is not possessive.
Love is not anxious to impress nor does it cherish inflated ideas of its own ideas.
Love has good manners and does not pursue selfish advantage.
Love is not touchy.
Love does not keep account of evil or gloat over the wickedness of other people. On the contrary, it is glad with all good men when truth prevails.
Love knows no limits to its endurance, no end to its trust, no fading of its hope; it can outlast anything. It is, in fact, the one thing that stands when all else has fallen.”



“If you spend your life sparing people’s feelings and feeding their vanity, you get so you can’t distinguish what should be respected in them.”



“If a man can possess a woman sexually -really possess- he won't need to control her ideas, her opinions, her clothes, her friends, even her other lovers.”

“Death is the easy part, the hard part is living and knowing you could be so much more then you’re willing to be.”

“Siblings: children of the same parents, each of whom is perfectly normal until they get together.”

“Caring about someone isn't complicated. It isn't easy. But it isn't complicated, either. Kinda like lifting the engine block out of a car.”



“But in the real world, you couldnt really just split a family down the middle, mom on one side, dad the other, with the child equally divided between. It was like when you ripped a piece of paper into two: no matter how you tried, the seams never fit exactly right again. It was what you couldn't see, those tiniest of pieces, that were lost in the severing, and their absence kept everything from being complete.”



“I hope we'll be friends forever, together we'll always be. I don't think you understand just how much you mean to me. And one day when we part our ways, we'll think back to the past and think about how happy we are 'cause our friendship will always last.”

“Your absence has not taught me to be alone, it merely has shown that when together we cast a single shadow on the wall.”

“When we fail to set boundaries and hold people accountable, we feel used and mistreated. This is why we sometimes attack who they are, which is far more hurtful than addressing a behavior or a choice.”



“When forever becomes a place...when forever ceases to be just a word… when it ceases to be just a measurement of time…but instead becomes a place where soul mates can dance to the song in their hearts... that is a reflection of true love.”



“Why don’t we break up? I guess I stay with her because she stays with me. And that’s not an easy thing to do.”



“The end of a relationship is not always a failure. Sometimes all the love in the world is not enough to save something. In these cases, it is not a matter of fault from either person. Some things cannot be, it's as simple as that.”

“Falling in love in a Christian way is to say,'I am excited about your future and I want to be part of getting you there. I'm signing up for the journey with you. Would you sign up for the journey to my true self with me? It's going to be hard but I want to get there.”

I felt silly for even mentioning it, but once I did, I knew I had to explain.
"When I was a kid, "I had this puzzle with all fifty states on it--you know, the kind where you have to fit them all together. And one day I got it in my head that California and Nevada were in love. I told my mom, and she had no idea what I was talking about. I ran and got those two pieces and showed it to her--California and Nevada, completely in love. So a lot of the time when we're like this"--my ankles against the backs of your ankles, my knees fitting into the backs of your knees, my thighs on the backs of your legs, my stomach against your back, my chin folding into your neck--"I can't help but think about California and Nevada, and how we're a lot like them. If someone were drawing us from above as a map. that's what we'd look like; that's how we are."
For a moment, you were quiet. And then you nestled in and whispered.
"Contiguous."
And I knew you understood.”



“Husbands are chiefly good as lovers when they are betraying their wives.”

“We met each other when we were young, before we knew enough about disappointment, and once we did we found we reminded each other of it.”



“I didn't know someone could love me like this," she said. "Could love me and love me and love me without...needing space."
Lincoln wasn't asleep. He rolled on top of her.
"There's no air in space," he said.”



“She preferred imaginary heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter were less manageable.”



“One of the most important of life´s lessons is to learn independance, to understand freedom. This means independence from attachments, from results, from opinions, and from expectations. Breaking attachments leads to freedom, but breaking attachments does not mean abandoning a loving and meaningful relationship, a relationship that nourrishes your soul. It means ending dependency on any person or thing. Love is never a dependency.”



“Hide yourself in God, so when a man wants to find you he will have to go there first.”

“But whenever I meet dynamic, nonretarded Americans, I notice that they all seem to share a single unifying characteristic: the inability to experience the kind of mind-blowing, transcendent romantic relationship they perceive to be a normal part of living. And someone needs to take the fall for this. So instead of blaming no one for this (which is kind of cowardly) or blaming everyone (which is kind of meaningless), I'm going to blame John Cusack.”



“Don't let a thief into your house three times. The first time was enough. The second time was a chance. The third time means you're stupid.”

“And for that one moment of freedom you have to listen to all that love crap... it drive me nuts sometimes... I want to kick them out immediately... I do now and then. But that doesn't keep them away. They like it, in fact. The less you notice them the more they chase after you. There's something perverse about women... they're all masochists at heart.”



“Please, touch me, I pray.”



“Words were weapons, his father had taught him that, and he'd wanted to hurt Clary more than he'd ever wanted to hurt any girl. In fact, he wasn't sure he had ever wanted to hurt a girl before. Usually he just wanted them, and then he wanted them to leave him alone.”



“I make love with a focus and intensity that most people reserve for sleep.”



“My love is pizza shaped. Won’t you have a slice? It’s circular, so there’s enough to go around. ”



“Hugh and I have been together for so long that in order to arouse extraordinary passion, we need to engage in physical combat. Once, he hit me on the back of the head with a broken wineglass, and I fell to the floor pretending to be unconscious. That was romantic, or would have been had he rushed to my side rather than stepping over my body to fetch the dustpan.”




“Maybe you could be mine / or maybe we’ll be entwined / aimless in this sexless foreplay.”



“I don't understand dating.. and the other things that people do.. all I know is that you ought to find the one you recognize. The one who gives you four arms, four legs, four eyes, and has the other half of your heart. There's only one of those, so what are all the other things for? Like dating?”

“Being single doesn't mean you're weak, it means that you're strong enough to wait for the right person.”

“But it is impossible to go through life without trust; that is to be imprisoned in the worst cell of all, oneself.”



“All I want from you is to trust me with what little you can, and grow in loving people around you with the same love I share with you. It's not your job to change them, or to convince them. You are free to love without an agenda.”



“Everything you want in life is a relationship away.”



“Love lasts about seven years. That's how long it takes for the cells of the body to totally replace themselves.”

“..he may love you, he may miss you, but ultimately he's just not that into you.”



“My wife and I just don't have the same feelings for each other we used to have. I guess I just don't love her anymore and she doesn't love me. What can i do?"
"The feeling isn't there anymore?" I asked.
"That's right," he reaffirmed. "And we have three children we're really concerned about. What do you suggest?"
"love her," I replied.
"I told you, the feeling just isn't there anymore."
"Love her."
"You don't understand. the feeling of love just isn't there."
"Then love her. If the feeling isn't there, that's a good reason to love her."
"But how do you love when you don't love?"
"My friend , love is a verb. Love - the feeling - is a fruit of love, the verb. So love her. Serve her. Sacrifice. Listen to her. Empathize. Appreciate. Affirm her. Are you willing to do that?”



“Life contains but two tragedies. One is not to get your heart’s desire; the other is to get it.”

“Single is no longer a lack of options – but a choice. A choice to refuse to let your life be defined by your relationship status but to live every day Happily and let your Ever After work itself out.”



“Ultimately the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or in friendship, is conversation, and conversation must have a common basis, and between two people of widely different culture the only common basis possible is the lowest level.”

“If you have the woman you love, what more do you need? Well, besides an alibi for the time of her husband’s murder. ”



“Be sure it's your real self you're showing. Because it is your real self that needs to be loved.”



“I've heard that people stand in bad situations because a relationship like that gets turned up by degrees. It is said that a frog will jump out of a pot of boiling water. Place him in a pot and turn it up a little at a time, and he will stay until he is boiled to death. Us frogs understand this.”



“He knew me in all the ways that truly mattered: the shape of my fears, the contours of my dreams.”

“I believe with all my heart that the cliches are true, that we are our own best friends and best company, and that if you're not right for yourself, it's impossible to be right for anyone.”



“Sometimes to self-discover you must self-destruct.”

“Intimacy requires courage because risk is inescapable. We cannot know at the outset how the relationship will affect us. Like a chemical mixture, if one of us is changed, both of us will be. Will we grow in self-actualization, or will it destroy us? The one thing we can be certain of is that if we let ourselves fully into the relationship for good or evil, we will not come out unaffected.”



“How could you love us being together?" he asked me "We are nothing alike and we are not meant for each other and we drive each other crazy, you love that? How can you love that?" So I told him "I know that we're not meant for each other, that we drive each other crazy, and that we are so different. But that's us. That's what we have; a wild nonsense. We are not good together, but together we are bad for each other. I love us together this way just like this. Because even if it's no good, it's what we have! It's us.”

“Every now and then, I’d meet a guy and think that we were getting along great, and suddenly I’d stop hearing from him. Not only did he stop calling, but if I happened to bump into him sometime later he always acted like I had the plague. I didn’t understand it. I still don’t. And it bothered me. It hurt me. With time, it got harder and harder to keep blaming the guys, and I eventually came to the conclusion that there was something wrong with me. That maybe I was simply meant to live my life alone.”



“Don’t spoil me with your lies, love me with your truth.”



“Visionary feminism is a wise and loving politics. It is rooted in the love of male and female being, refusing to privilege one over the other. The soul of feminist politics is the commitment to ending patriarchal domination of women and men, girls and boys. Love cannot exist in any relationship that is based on domination and coercion. Males cannot love themselves in patriarchal culture if their very self-definition relies on submission to patriarchal rules. When men embrace feminist thinking and preactice, which emphasizes the value of mutual growth and self-actualization in all relationships, their emotional well-being will be enhanced. A genuine feminist politics always brings us from bondage to freedom, from lovelessness to loving.”

“If he can't handle you at your worst then he does not deserve you at your best. Real love means seeing beyond the words spoken out of pain, and instead seeing a person's soul.”



“People are islands,' she said. 'They don't really touch. However close they are, they're really quite separate. Even if they've been married for fifty years.”



“No matter how much you love someone, you still want to have you own way.”



“Human relationships always help us to carry on because they always presuppose further developments, a future - and also because we live as if our only task was precisely to have relationships with other people.”

“I think of how each person in a marriage owes it to the other to find individual happiness, even in a shared life. That this is the only way to grow together, instead of apart.”



“She asked if I loved another woman, so I answered honestly and said, “Dinner was great, but I could go for dessert.”



“There isn't time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that.”

“You can be in love and you can be in a relationship. But they’re not always the same thing.”




“I could’ve sworn I was telling the truth when I told you I didn’t miss you.”



“I used to think I knew everything. I was a "smart person" who "got things done," and because of that, the higher I climbed, the more I could look down and scoff at what seemed silly or simple, even religion.
But I realized something as I drove home that night: that I am neither better nor smarter, only luckier. And I should be ashamed of thinking I knew everything, because you can know the whole world and still feel lost in it. So many people are in pain-no matter how smart or accomplished-they cry, they yearn, they hurt.But instead of looking down on things, they look up, which is where I should have been looking, too. Because when the world quiets to the sound of your own breathing, we all want the same things:comfort, love, and a peaceful heart.”



“It can be difficult to leave a long-term relationship, even when our inner-wisdom tells us it's time to let go. At this point, we can choose let go and endure the intense pain of leaving behind the familiar to make way for a new chapter in our life. Or we can stay and suffer a low-grade pain that slowly eats away at our heart and soul, like an emotional cancer. Until we wake up, one day and realize, we are buried so deep in the dysfunction of the relationship that we scarcely remember who we were and what we wanted and needed to be.”

“When you say "I" and "my" too much, you lose the capacity to understand the "we" and "our".”



“People will walk in and walk out of your life, but the one whose footstep made a long lasting impression is the one you should never allow to walk out.”

“How would your life be different if…You approached all relationships with authenticity and honesty? Let today be the day…You dedicate yourself to building relationships on the solid foundation of truth and authenticity.”



“The true measure of a man is how he treats you when others are not looking.”

“In this story
I am the poet
You're the poetry.”

“Either you go to America with Mrs. Van Hopper or you come home to Manderley with me."
"Do you mean you want a secretary or something?"
"No, I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool.”



“A tamed woman will never leave her mark in the world.”

“Share too much and someone can hurt you.”



“Her face looked ugly in the attempt to avoid tears; it was an ugliness which bound him to her more than any beauty could have done. It isn't being happy together, he thought as though it were a fresh discovery, that makes one love--it's being unhappy together.”



“There are all kinds of ways for a relationship to be tested, even broken, some, irrevocably; it’s the endings we’re unprepared for.”



“A woman can become a man's friend only in the following stages - first an acquantaince, next a mistress, and only then a friend.”



“I once loved a girl who almost loved me, but not as much as she loved John Cusack.”



“Relationships never provide you with everything. They provide you with some things. You take all the things you want from a person -- sexual chemistry, let's say, or good conversation, or financial support, or intellectual compatibility, or niceness, or loyalty -- and you get to pick three of those things. The rest you have to look for elsewhere. It's only in the movies that you find someone who gives you all those things. But this isn't the movies. In the real world, you have to identify which three qualities you want to spend the rest of your life with, and then you look for those qualities in another person. That's real life. Don't you see it's a trap? If you keep trying to find everything, you'll wind up with nothing.”



“There is an emotional promiscuity we’ve noticed among many good young men and women. The young man understands something of the journey of the heart. He wants to talk, to “share the journey.” The woman is grateful to be pursued, she opens up. They share the intimacies of their lives - their wounds, their walks with God. But he never commits. He enjoys her... then leaves. And she wonders, What did I do wrong? She failed to see his passivity. He really did not ever commit or offer assurances that he would. Like Willoughby to Marianne in Sense and Sensibility.
Be careful you do not offer too much of yourself to a man until you have good, solid evidence that he is a strong man willing to commit. Look at his track record with other women. Is there anything to be concerned about there? If so, bring it up. Also, does he have any close male friends - and what are they like as men? Can he hold down a job? Is he walking with God in a real and intimate way? Is he facing the wounds of his own life, and is he also demonstrating a desire to repent of Adam’s passivity and/or violence? Is he headed somewhere with his life? A lot of questions, but your heart is a treasure, and we want you to offer it only to a man who is worthy and ready to handle it well.”



“To find out if she really loved me, I hooked her up to a lie detector. And just as I suspected, my machine was broken. ”



“The desire to love someone always exceeds the desire to be loved by someone & that's exactly why we end up loving the person who doesn't deserve that LOVE.”



“Tell me whom you haunt and I’ll tell you who you are.”

“We know so little about one another. We embrace a shadow and love a dream.”



“Two separate beings, in different circumstances, face to face in freedom and seeking justification of their existence through one another, will always live an adventure full of risk and promise." (p. 248)”



“Lately I can't help wanting us
to be like other people.
For example, if I were a smoker,
you'd lift a match to the cigarette
just as I put it between my lips.
It's never been like that
between us: none of that
easy chemistry, no quick, half automatic
flares. Everything between us
had to be learned.
Saturday finds me brooding
behind my book, all my fantasies
of seduction run up
against the rocks.
Tell me again
why you don't like
sex in the afternoon?
No, don't tell me--
I'll never understand you
never understand us, America's strangest
loving couple: they never
drink a bottle of wine together
and rarely look at each other.
Into each other's eyes, I mean.”



“So many believe that it is love that grows, but it is the knowing that grows and love simply expands to contain it.”



“i’m not scared
of the monsters
hidden underneath
my bed.
i’m much more scared
of the boys
with messy brown hair,
sleepy eyes,
& mouths
that only know
how to form
half-truths.”



“I had a dream about you. You were an escalator, and I was a flight of stairs. You thought I was a Luddite, and I thought I was as ostrich, because I hadn’t figured out how to put the fly in flight. One day you broke down, and then you saw that you and I weren’t so different after all.”



“I had a dream about you. We installed Dr. Robert Jarvik’s artificial heart in a mannequin and brought it to life, only to later kill it because a creature that’s all fake heart and no brain is what’s commonly called a “politician,” and must be destroyed. ”



“I never hated a man enough to give him his diamonds back.”

“The best you can hope for in a relationship is to find
someone whose flaws are the sort you don’t mind. It is
futile to look for someone who has no flaws, or someone
who is capable of significant change; that sort of person
exists only in our imaginations.”




“Share your weaknesses. Share your hard moments. Share your real side. It'll either scare away every fake person in your life or it will inspire them to finally let go of that mirage called "perfection," which will open the doors to the most important relationships you'll ever be a part of.”



“I realized I’m in love. It's always been right in front of me.”



“The more you talk about it, rehash it, rethink it, cross analyze it, debate it, respond to it, get paranoid about it, compete with it, complain about it, immortalize it, cry over it, kick it, defame it, stalk it, gossip about it, pray over it, put it down or dissect its motives it continues to rot in your brain. It is dead. It is over. It is gone. It is done. It is time to bury it because it is smelling up your life and no one wants to be near your rotted corpse of memories and decaying attitude. Be the funeral director of your life and bury that thing!”

“So often survivors have had their experiences denied, trivialized, or distorted. Writing is an important avenue for healing because it gives you the opportunity to define your own reality. You can say: This did happen to me. It was that bad. It was the fault & responsibility of the adult. I was—and am—innocent.” The Courage to Heal by Ellen Bass & Laura Davis”



“Better to put your heart on the line, risk everything, and walk away with nothing than play it safe. Love is a lot of things, but “safe” isn’t one of them.”



“You want to take me to a movie?" I asked.
"Well, not really," he said. "What I really want is for you to be my girlfriend. But I thought saying that might scare you off.”



“They hurt you. You hurt 'em back. Or maybe it is the other way around. Whatever. Someday you might find a way to forgive each other. But it won't be like it used to 'cause that pain never really goes away.”



“He doesn't need to be reminded you're great.”



“Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.”



“Funny how we take it for granted that we know all there is to know about another person, just because we see them frequently or because of some strong emotional tie.”



“My dad had limitations. That's what my good-hearted mom always told us. He had limitations, but he meant no harm. It was kind of her to say, but he did do harm.”



“The best kind of humans are the ones who stay.”

“We swallowed the chaos because we knew we didn't want to be ordinary.”

“The single greatest lesson the garden teaches is that our relationship to the planet need not be zero-sum, and that as long as the sun still shines and people still can plan and plant, think and do, we can, if we bother to try, find ways to provide for ourselves without diminishing the world. ”



“Your heart’s strength is measured by how hard it holds on. Your self worth and faith is measured by finally letting go. However, your peace is measured by how long you don’t look back.”

“What a relationship looks like on the outside isn't the same as what it's like on the inside. You can be more in love with someone in your mind than with the person you see every day.”



“One minute of reconciliation is worth more than a whole life of friendship!”



“I remember one desolate Sunday night, wondering: Is this how I´m going to spend the rest of my life? Marrid to someone who is perpetually distracted and somewhat wistful, as though a marvelous party is going on in the next room, which but for me he could be attending?”

“The real thing that keeps men and women apart, is fear. Women blame men and men blame women, but the culprit is fear, women are afraid of one thing, men are afraid of a different thing; the fears of women have to do with losing while the fears of men have to do with not being good enough for something. One is loss, the other is insecurity. Men are innately more insecure than women and women are innately more needful of companionship than men. It's good for both men and women to be able to recognize and identify these fears not only within themselves, but within each other, and then men and women will see that they really do need to help each other. It's not a game, it's not a competition, the two sexes need one another.”

“He who wants a rose must respect her thorn.”

“Why does anyone stay in an unhappy relationship? Because people do. They do it all the time. And the truth is, when you’re in it, when you’re up to your neck in the everyday part of life with another human being, sometimes you don’t exactly notice how bad things really are. It’s not always as apparent as it would seem. Unhappiness, when it involves another person, can be like that line from The Sun Also Rises about going bankrupt, how it happens two ways: gradually, and then suddenly.”

“love one another, but make not a bond of love:
let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.
fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.
give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf
sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,
even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.”



“This emotion I'm feeling now, this is love, right?"
"I don't know. Is it a longing? Is it a giddy stupid happiness just because you're with me?"
"Yes," she said.
"That's influenza," said Miro. "Watch for nausea or diarrhea within a few hours.”



“Love doesn’t have to be on Valentine’s Day. It doesn’t have to be by the time you turn eighteen or thirty-three or fifty-nine. It doesn’t have to conform to whatever is usual. It doesn’t have to be kismet at once, or rhapsody by the third day.
It just has to be. In time. In place. In spirt.
It just has to be.”



“If I say your voice is an amber waterfall in which I yearn to burn each day, if you eat my mouth like a mystical rose with powers of healing and damnation, If I confess that your body is the only civilization I long to experience… would it mean that we are close to knowing something about love?”



“Was it necessary to tell me that you wanted nothing in the world but me?'
The corners of his mouth drooped peevishly.
Oh, my dear, it's rather hard to take quite literally the things a man says when he's in love with you.'
Didn't you mean them?'
At the moment.”



“An honorable human relationship – that is, one in which two people have the right to use the word "love" – is a process, delicate, violent, often terrifying to both persons involved, a process of refining the truths they can tell each other.
It is important to do this because it breaks down human self-delusion and isolation.
It is important to do this because in doing so we do justice to our own complexity.
It is important to do this because we can count on so few people to go that hard way with us.”



“You get lonely, is what it is. A person's not supposed to go through life with absolutely nobody. It's not normal. The longer you go by yourself the weirder you get, and the weirder you get the longer you go by yourself. It's a loop and you gotta do something to get out of it.”

“Relationships take up energy; letting go of them, psychiatrists theorize, entails mental work. When you lose someone you were close to, you have to reassess your picture of the world and your place in it. The more your identity was wrapped up with the deceased, the more difficult the loss.”

“It’s all about falling in love with yourself and sharing that love with someone who appreciates you, rather than looking for love to compensate for a self love deficit.”

“If you're right & I'm not, I'm going to be hell to live with, she said. So, you better think about that next time you want to be right. ”

“Somewhere along the way we all go a bit mad. So burn, let go and dive into the horror, because maybe it’s the chaos which helps us find where we belong.”

“Laughter is more than just a pleasurable activity...When people laugh together, they tend to talk and touch more and to make eye contact more frequently.”




“We walked to meet each other up at the time of our love and then we have been irresistibly drifting in different directions, and there's no altering that.”



“Over time as most people fail the survivor's exacting test of trustworthiness, she tends to withdraw from relationships. The isolation of the survivor thus persists even after she is free.”



“I used to think--and given the way we ended up, maybe I still do--that all relationships need the kind of violent shove that a crush brings, just to get you started and to push you over the humps. And then, when the energy from that shove has gone and you come to something approaching a halt, you have to look around and see what you've got. It could be something completely different, it could be something roughly the same, but gentler and calmer, or it could be nothing at all.”



“You'll blow up a helicopter, but you won't go out with me? What is
wrong
with you?”



“Dignity will only happen when you realize that having someone in your life doesn’t validate your worth.”

“Bathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self-reliant women love when they abandon their self-reliance. When a strong woman recklessly throws away her strength she is worse than a weak woman who has never any strength to throw away. One source of her inadequacy is the novelty of the occasion. She has never had practice in making the best of such a condition. Weakness is doubly weak by being new.”



“If you walked away from a
toxic, negative, abusive,
one-sided, dead-end
low vibrational
relationship or friendship
— you won.”

“It seems to me that if you place music (and books, probably, and films, and plays, and anything that makes you feel) at the center of your being, then you can’t afford to sort out your love life, start to think of it as the finished product. You’ve got to pick at it, keep it alive and in turmoil, you’ve got to pick at it and unravel it until it all comes apart and you’re compelled to start all over again. Maybe we all live life at too high a pitch, those of us who absorb emotional things all day, and as a consequence we can never feel merely content: we have to be unhappy, or ecstatically, head-over-heels happy, and those states are difficult to achieve within a stable, solid relationship.”

“Never judge someone by their relatives.”



“Truth is, something that I thought was perfect was taken away from me, and I never wanted perfect again. I wanted middle of the road, stuff I didn’t care about so that I couldn’t lose anything I really loved ever again.”



“Madness and chaos are self-destructing but over thinking is the suicide.”

“Women writers make for rewarding (and efficient) lovers. They are clever liars to fathers and husbands; yet they never hold their tongues too long, nor keep ardent typing fingers still.”



“Then you must tell 'em dat love ain't somethin' lak uh grindstone dat's de same thing everywhere and do de same thing tuh everything it touch. Love is lak de sea. It's uh movin' thing, but still and all, it takes its shape from de shore it meets, and it's different with every shore.”



“Time has its revenges, but revenge seems so often sour. Wouldn’t we all do better not trying to understand, accepting the fact that no human being will ever understand another, not a wife with a husband, nor a parent a child? Perhaps that’s why men have invented God – a being capable of understanding. ”



“But I think we both knew, even then, that what we had was something even more rare, and even more meaningful. I was going to be his friend, and was going to show him possibilities. And he, in turn, would become someone I could trust more than myself.”



“Love has no limitations. It cannot be measured. It has no boundaries. Although many have tried, love is indefinable.”



“To gaze into another persons face is to do two things: to recognise their humanity and to assert your own.”



“She is delightfully chaotic; a beautiful mess. Loving her is a splendid adventure.”

“Daughter! Get you an honest Man for a Husband, and keep him honest. No matter whether he is rich, provided he be independent. Regard the Honour and moral Character of the Man more than all other Circumstances. Think of no other Greatness but that of the soul, no other Riches but those of the Heart. An honest, Sensible humane Man, above all the Littlenesses of Vanity, and Extravagances of Imagination, labouring to do good rather than be rich, to be usefull rather than make a show, living in a modest Simplicity clearly within his Means and free from Debts or Obligations, is really the most respectable Man in Society, makes himself and all about him the most happy.”



“Some of the biggest challenges in relationships come from the fact that most people enter a relationship in order to get something: they're trying to find someone who's going to make them feel good. In reality, the only way a relationship will last is if you see your relationship as a place that you go to give, and not a place that you go to take. ”

“Where the lips are silent the heart has a thousand tongues.”



“Basically, all women are nurturers and healers, and all men are mental patients to varying degrees.”



“Don't answer the door in a wedding dress and veil, he might not think you're joking.”



“Annabeth realized that if six of them went on these two quests, it would leave Percy alone on the ship with Coach Hedge, which was maybe not a situation a caring girlfriend should put him in. Nor was she eager to let Percy out of her sight again—not after they’d been apart for so many months.”



“It is necessary to fall in love – the better to provide an alibi for all the despair we are going to feel anyway.”

“A friend is someone whose face you can see in the dark.”




“Theresa, I know there's a part of you that believes you can change someone, but the reality is that you can't. You can change yourself, and Garrett can change himself, but you can't do it for him.”



“People generally didn't cheat in good relationships.”



“I know I'm not going to be in your head all the time. But once you know me, I'll be forever in your heart. ”



“Most don't deserve your tears... and the ones that do will never make you cry.”



“I barely know him. I guess that is every relationship. You start with nothing and maybe end with everything.”



“I'm done. I don't need anything more out of life. I have you, and that's enough.”

“A broken heart is just the growing pains necessary so that you can love more completely when the real thing comes along.”



“I think when men hear that women want a commitment, they think it means commitment to a romantic relationship, but that's not it. It's a commitment to not floating around anywhere. I want a guy who is entrenched in his own life.”



“She was broken, I think it’s because she loved too much and she was always blind to the fact that love too is sometimes broken.”

“How was I supposed to know what’s real and what’s not? It feels like I’m the only one who doesn’t know the difference.”



“In the best, the friendliest and simplest relations flattery or praise is necessary, just as grease is necessary to keep wheels turning. ”



“Until we can receive with an open heart, we are never really giving with an open heart.”



“I had a dream about you last night. The champagne was non-alcoholic. You didn't notice, and laughed at my jokes anyway.”



“To be deeply loved, means a willingness to cut yourself wide open, exposing your vulnerabilities... hopes, hurts, fears and flaws. Hiding behind the highlight reel of who you are, is the real you and that person is just as worthy of love. There is nothing more terrifying or fulfilling, than complete love, it's worth the risk... reach for it.”

“I thought he should have realized sooner that important people don't show up very often, and you should hold on to them when they do. Maybe I was smarter than he was all along, because that was something I'd always known.”



“Delusion detests focus and romance provides the veil.”



“You didn't just cheat on me; you cheated on us. You didn't just break my heart; you broke our future.”



“Having a sister or a friend is like sitting at night in a lighted house. Those outside can watch you if they want, but you need not see them. You simply say, "Here are the perimeters of our attention. If you prowl around under the windows till the crickets go silent, we will pull the shades. If you wish us to suffer your envious curiosity, you must permit us not to notice it." Anyone with one solid human bond is that smug, and it is the smugness as much as the comfort and safety that lonely people covet and admire.”



“I have to go. I have a finite amount of life left and I don't want to spend it arguing with you.”



“Become the leader of your life. Lead yourself to where you want to be. Breathe life back into your ambitions, your desires, your goals, your relationships.”



“Trust and faith bring joy to life and help relationships grow to their maximum potential.”



“The heart is like a woman, and the head is like a man, and although man is the head of woman, woman is the heart of man, and she turns man's head because she turns his heart.”



“But what are loyalty and caring really worth?"
"To me? Everything.”



“To us, your power comes from one simple thing: you’re a woman, and we men will do
anything humanly possible to impress you so that, ultimately, we can be with you. You’re the driving force behind why we wake up every day. Men go out and get jobs and hustle to make
money because of women. We drive fancy cars because of women. We dress nice, put on cologne, get haircuts and try to look all shiny and new for you. We do all of this because the more our game is stepped up, the more of you we get. You’re the ultimate prize to us.”



“I can see that the sadness has returned. And it's not a beautiful sadness- beautiful sadness is a myth. Sadness turns our features to clay, not porcelain.”



“Be a bit of a challenge; not because you're playing games but because you realize you're worth the extra effort.”



“We've lost a lot of years, but you can't lose love. Not real love. It stays locked inside you, ready for whenever you are strong enough to find it again.”



“I will never deny that life isn't fair. It seems as though when a woman leaves a man she is strong and independent, but when a man leaves a woman he is a pig and a jerk.”



“I had a dream about you last night.. you were holding a pine cone and introducing him as Gerald.”



“So I learned two things that night, and the next day, from him: the perfection of a moment, and the fleeting nature of it.”




“Relationships are treated like Dixie cups. They are the same. They are disposable. If it does not work, drop it, throw it away, get another.
Committed bonds (including marriage) cannot last when this is the prevailing logic. Most of us are unclear about what to do to protect and strengthen caring bonds when our self-centered needs are not being met.”



“أريدك أن تعرف المزيد عن النساء مما لن تخبرك به واحده منهن.. إن النساء لا يطلبن الاهتمام ولكنهن يسعين إلى يجدن ذلك الرجل الذى يهتم بهن فعلا..”



“Somewhere between love and hate lies confusion, misunderstanding and desperate hope.”

“Encouragement requires empathy and seeing the world from your spouse's perspective. We must first learn what is important to our spouse. Only then can we give encouragement. With verbal encouragement, we are trying to communicate, "I know. I care. I am with you. How can I help?" We are trying to show that we believe in him and in his abilities. We are giving credit and praise.”



“Truth builds trust.”

“Why be alone when we can be together baby
You can make my life worthwhile
And I can make you start to smile”

“If I lived a million lives, I would've felt a million feelings and I still would've fallen a million times for you.”

“I used to loathe ambivalence; now I adore it. Ambivalence is my new best friend.”



“Society will always be too fragile to accept us for all that makes us beautiful.”

“It’s funny, for all it took was a broken heart and that alone was enough, enough for her to do everything she ever dreamed of.”

“Appreciate the moment of a first kiss; it may be the last time you own your heart.”

“The truth is I didn’t need therapy; I just needed to feel loved and know that someone out there craved my attention.”

“Never knew what a friendship was, Never knew how to really love, You can't be what I need you to, & I don't know why I fuck with you”

“I just want someone to hear what I have to say. And maybe if I talk long enough, it’ll make sense.”



“In any relationship in which two people become one, the end result is two half people.”

“The strength of a man isn't seen in the power of his arms. It's seen in the love with which he EMBRACES you.”



“One thing I've learned is it's better to be addicted to things than people. You get hooked on a
thing
and if someone takes it from you, you can find another source. Only people can really hurt you. Only people can push you out into the cold permanently.”



“There is no mystery-- that's the beauty of it. We are entirely explicable to each other, and yet we stay. What a miracle that is.”



“The foundation of adult trust is not "You will never hurt me." It is "I trust myself with whatever you do.”



“For [erotically intelligent couples], love is a vessel that contains both security and adventure, and commitment offers one of the great luxuries of life: time. Marriage is not the end of romance, it is the beginning. They know that they have years in which to deepen their connection, to experiment, to regress, and even to fail. They see their relationship as something alive and ongoing, not a fait accompli. It’s a story that they are writing together, one with many chapters, and neither partner knows how it will end. There’s always a place they haven’t gone yet, always something about the other still to be discovered.”



“Relationships are never about power, and one way to avoid the will to power is to choose to limit oneself- to serve.”



“With each reunion (we) had to learn each other all over again. There was always that nervous moment at the airport when I would stand there waiting for him to arrive, wondering, Will I still know him? Will he still know me?”



“There was no one to be seen so she gave in freely to her sobs as she made her way home, pressed her arms against her stomach; the pain lodged in there like an ill-tempered foetus.

Let a person in and he hurts you.
There was a reason why she kept her relationships brief. Don't let them in. Once they're inside they have more potential to hurt you. Comfort yourself. You can live with the anguish as long as it only involves yourself. As long as there is no hope.”



“Regrets came up and asked me if I’d like to own them. Declined them for the most part but took a few just so I wouldn’t leave this relationship empty handed.”



“A person shows signs of clutching on too fast, of being needy, of not hearing the word "no," of jealousy, of guarding you and your freedom. But the signs can be so small they skitter right past you. Sometimes they dance past, looking satiny, something you should applaud. Someone's jealousy can make you feel good. Special. But it's not even about you. It's about a hand that is already gripping. It's about their need, circling around your throat”



“In love, women are professionals, men are amateurs”

“If we can’t repair things with the Romans—well, the two sets of demigods have
never
gotten along. That’s why the gods kept us separate. I don’t know if we could ever belong there.”
Percy didn’t want to argue, but he couldn’t let go of the hope. It felt important—not just for him, but for all the other demigods. It
had
to be possible to belong in two different worlds at once. After all, that’s what being a demigod was all about—not quite belonging in the mortal world or on Mount Olympus, but trying to make peace with both sides of their nature.”



“After their encounter on the approach to Jupiter, there would aways be a secret bond between them---not of love, but of tenderness, which is often more enduring.”



“To be honest, it was pretty hard to leave. I desperately wanted to turn around, and tell him everything would be okay. That I adore him and I trust him and that I'll stand by him while he goes through this tough time. But I'm just too tired. I'm thirty years old. I'm tired of relationships that are always painful. I'm tired of hurting. I'm tired of waiting by the phone, and second-guessing what a guy says and trusting someone not to hurt me. Again. I've been storming the relationship castle for fifteen years, and I still don't have my prince. I've got a bunch of battle scars from the field and I want to go home and nurse my wounds. I don't want to fight anymore.”



“Men are jealous of every woman, even when they don’t have the slightest interest in her themselves.”




“Love is giving up control. It’s surrendering the desire to control the other person. The two—love and controlling power over the other person—are mutually exclusive. If we are serious about loving someone, we have to surrender all the desires within us to manipulate the relationship.”



“I hate the way, once you start to know someone, care about them, their behavior can distress you, even when it's unreasonable and not your fault, even if you were really trying to be careful, tactful.”



“Jesus waited three days to come back to life. It was perfect! If he had only waited one day, a lot of people wouldn't have even heard he died. They'd be all, "Hey Jesus, what up?" and Jesus would probably be like, "What up? I died yesterday!" and they'd be all, "Uh, you look pretty alive to me, dude..." and then Jesus would have to explain how he was resurrected, and how it was a miracle, and the dude'd be like "Uhh okay, whatever you say, bro..." And he's not gonna come back on a Saturday. Everybody's busy, doing chores, workin' the loom, trimmin' the beard, NO. He waited the perfect number of days, three. Plus it's Sunday, so everyone's in church already, and they're all in there like "Oh no, Jesus is dead", and then BAM! He bursts in the back door, runnin' up the aisle, everyone's totally psyched, and FYI, that's when he invented the high five. That's why we wait three days to call a woman, because that's how long Jesus wants us to wait.... True story.”

“I need to figure out the secret. I need to work out how to keep things flying back to me instead of always flying away.”



“Nothing is stranger or more ticklish than a relationship between people who know each other only by sight, who meet and observe each other daily - no hourly - and are nevertheless compelled to keep up the pose of an indifferent stranger, neither greeting nor addressing each other, whether out of etiquette or their own whim.”



“Suddenly, everything was beautiful. The way she viewed the world was nothing more but a reflection of herself.”

“Asking for help with shame says:
You have the power over me.
Asking with condescension says:
I have the power over you.
But asking for help with gratitude says:
We have the power to help each other.
”



“You don't stop loving someone just because you hate them.”



“If there is one thing I can pass on from my humbling experiences in life, thus far, I will tell you this, the next time someone tells you "the absence of expectations is the absence of disappointment, do not listen. Have expectations. Keep them great. It'll be a very bumpy ride. You'll even get bruised, sometimes very badly. Sometimes, you'll come to an abrupt halt or even fall off your ride. But you'll grow. And if you do not grow, you do not live.”

“What if we just acknowledged that we have a bad relationship, and we stuck it out, anyway? What if we admitted that we make each other nuts, we fight constantly and hardly ever have sex, but we can't live without each other, so we deal with it? And then we could spend our lives together -- in misery, but happy to not be apart.”

“I had to learn to live without you and I couldn't make sense of it, because I left so much of me inside of you.”

“There's never a reason to trust someone. If there's a reason, then it's not trust.”



“To be human is to be broken and broken is its own kind of beautiful.”

“THE WEATHER OF LOVE
Love
Has a way of wilting
Or blossoming
At the strangest,
Most unpredictable hour.
This is how love is,
An uncontrollable beast
In the form of a flower.
The sun does not always shine on it.
Nor does the rain always pour on it
Nor should it always get beaten by a storm.
Love does not always emit the sweetest scents,
And sometimes it can sting with its thorns.
Water it.
Give it plenty of sunlight.
Nurture it,
And the flower of love will
Outlive you.
Neglect it or keep dissecting it,
And its petals will quickly curl up and die.
This is how love is,
Perfection is a delusional vision.
So love the person who loves you
Unconditionally,
And abandon the one
Who only loves you
Under favorable
Conditions.”



“She was still under the spell of her infatuation. She had tried to forget him, realizing the inutility of remembering. But the thought of him was like an obsession, ever pressing itself upon her. It was not that she dwelt upon details of their acquaintance, or recalled in any special or peculiar way his personality; it was his being, his existence, which dominated her thought, fading sometimes as if it would melt into the mist of the forgotten, reviving again with an intensity which filled her with an incomprehensible longing.”



“She was broken from moment to moment, watching her world collide she felt lost inside herself. She fell apart for a passion that flamed beneath her. She waited and died a hundred times, it dripped from her pores. The moment she let go, she soared over the stillness like the star she was born to be.”

“You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water...”



“Our love was a two-person game. At least until one of us died, and the other became a murderer. ”



“Ask yourself, does this person make me feel good about myself? Do I feel safe, strong and free with this person? Those are the questions you need to ask....You have to be strong to truly be open.”



“I think of how keenly I've been wrong. I think of all the gods I have made out of feeble men.”



“When the person you love can't see your love for them beneath the painful things you say when they reject you, remember this: Love is blind.”

“It's better to have a few faithful friends than numerous shallow friendships.”



“Sometimes you get everything you ever wanted, only it doesn't look like what you wanted anymore.”



“A relationship isn't something that has to be created in a day or perfected in a day. Part of the game is to keep working on it. It's something that'll always be just a little flawed.”

“Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.”



“Playing the victim role: Manipulator portrays him- or herself as a victim of circumstance or of someone else's behavior in order to gain pity, sympathy or evoke compassion and thereby get something from another. Caring and conscientious people cannot stand to see anyone suffering and the manipulator often finds it easy to play on sympathy to get cooperation.”



“Nobody is so busy that they can't make time for the people they really care about.”



“I believe that it is impossible for two individuals not committed to their own and each other’s well being to sustain a healthy and enduring relationship.”



“I had a dream about you. I was sitting on your couch, relating my succession of ideas on subconscious influence. I asked you what they meant, and you told me that free associations were a bad way to advance my political career.”



“So that’s how we live our lives. No matter how deep and fatal the
loss, no matter how important the thing that's stolen from us - that's
snatched right out of our hands - even if we are left completely
changed, with only the outer layer of skin from before, we continue to
play out our lives this way, in silence. We draw ever nearer to the
end of our allotted span of time, bidding it farewell as it trails off
behind. Repeating, often adroitly, the endless deeds of the everyday.
Leaving behind a feeling of insurmountable emptiness...
Maybe, in some distant place, everything is already, quietly, lost.
Or at least there exists a silent place where everything can
disappear, melting together in a single, overlapping figure. And as
we live our lives we discover - drawing toward us the thin threads
attached to each - what has been lost. I closed my eyes and tried to
bring to mind as many beautiful lost things as I could. Drawing them
closer, holding on to them. Knowing all the while that their lives
are fleeting.”




“Over time, any deception destroys intimacy, and without intimacy couples cannot have true and lasting love.”



“I'm tired of waiting by the phone, and second-guessing what a guy says and trusting someone not to hurt me. Again. I've been storming the relationship castle for fifteen years, and I still don't have my prince. I've got a bunch of battle scars from the field and I want to go home and nurse my wounds. I don't want to fight anymore.”



“If you have feelings for someone, let them know. It doesn’t matter if they can be in your life or not. Maybe, it is just enough for both of you to release the truth, so healing can occur. The opposite is true, as well. If you don’t have feelings for someone then never let another person suggest that you do. Protect your reputation and be responsible for the wrong information spread about you. Never allow anyone to live with a false belief or unfounded hope about you. An honorable person sets the record straight, so that person can move on with their life.”

“To love everyone unconditionally does not mean to give everyone your unconditional time. Sometimes, to love completely, we must never see someone again. This, too, is love. This is giving someone the freedom to exist and be happy, even if it must be without you.”

“When we love someone our love becomes demonstrable or real only through our exertion - through the fact that for that someone (or for ourself) we take an extra step or walk an extra mile. Love is not effortless. To the contrary, love is effortful.”



“To respect the dignity of a relationship also implies accepting the end when it comes. Except in my mind, except in my dreams, where the aftertaste of her still lingers.”



“Some of the most beautiful things we have in life comes from our mistakes.”

“Oh, he did look like a deity – the perfect balance of danger and charm, he was at the same time fascinating and inaccessible, distant because of his demonstrated flawlessness, and possessing such strength of character that he was dismaying and at the same time utterly attractive in an enticing and forbidden way.”



“It was never about the world being too big, it was more like she was too much for the world to handle.”

“Maybe I hope too much. Maybe I dream too much or maybe I love too much to just give up on you.”

“They had, finally, the only thing anyone really wants in life: someone to hold your hand when you die.”



“Dominator culture teaches all of us that the core of our identity is defined by the will to dominate and control others. We are taught that this will to dominate is more biologically hardwired in males than in females. In actuality, dominator culture teaches us that we are all natural-born killers but that males are more able to realize the predator role. In the dominator model the pursuit of external power, the ability to manipulate and control others, is what matters most. When culture is based on a dominator model, not only will it be violent but it will frame all relationships as power struggles.”

“Love doesn't come with an on-off switch. It's made of too many threads of memory and hope and heartache that weave themselves into the very core of who you are.”



“Lies don't end relationships the truth does.”

“It is not lies or a lack of loyalty that ends a relationship. It is the agonizing truth that one person feels in their heart on a daily basis. It is realizing that you are coping and not living. It is the false belief that there is a verse, quote, phrase or talk that will magically make you feel content, complete or not care. However, it doesn’t last longer than a few days, before your mind and heart goes back to what it wants. It is the moment you realize that you left without ever leaving. It is the moment you realize that fear, shame or guilt is the only thing standing in the way of the life God meant for you to live.”

“We are the sum of all people we have ever met; you change the tribe and the tribe changes you.”



“The bank of love is never bankrupt.”



“You can get away with saying much more with humor than you can with a straight face”



“Perhaps love is a minor madness. And as with madness, it's unendurable alone. The one person who can relieve us is of course the sole person we cannot go to: the one we love. So instead we seek out allies, even among strangers and wives, fellow patients who, if they can't touch the edge of our particular sorrow, have felt something that cuts nearly as deep.”



“Alas, woman is faithful as long as she loves, but you demand that she be faithful without love and give herself without enjoyment. Who is cruel then, woman or man?”



“I had a dream about you last night... you were a giant slinky and I watched you fall down the stairs.”



“A soul mate is not found. A soul mate is recognized.”



“Roen snorted. "You two have the strangest relationship in the Dells."
Archer smiled slightly. "She won't consent to make it a marriage."
"I can't imagine what's stopping her. I don't suppose you've considered being less munificent with your love?"
"Would you marry me, Fire, if I slept in no one's bed but yours?"
He knew the answer to that, but it didn't hurt to remind him. "No, and I should find my bed quite cramped.”



“we are threatened with suffering from three directions: from our body, which is doomed to decay..., from the external world which may rage against us with overwhelming and merciless force of destruction, and finally from our relations with other men... This last source is perhaps more painful to use than any other. (p77)”



“ان اكبر تحديات الرجل ترجمة كلام المرأة اذا تحدثت و مساندتها بالتفهم والتأييد المناسبين للموقف و لمشاعرها... و اكبر تحديات المرأة تأويل صمت الرجل و مساندته بتقبله و دعمه بان تترك له المساحة التي يحتاج اليها”



“He gave her a quick, casual kiss on the cheek first. Then came the hug, and it was the hug that always made Laurel’s heart mush. Serious grip, cheek to the hair, eyes closed, just a little sway. Del’s hugs mattered, she thought, and made him impossible to resist.”



“Terkadang,yang tak bisa kamu lupakan
adalah seseorang yang tak pernah bisa kamu miliki.”



“He needs "space" and "time," as if this were physics and not a human relationship.”



“From someone who doesn't want to share your destiny, you should neither accept a cigarette”



“Sometimes not talking is effortless, and other times it’s more exhausting than lifting pianos.”




“What is it about men that make women so lonely?”

“What marriage offers - and what fidelity is meant to protect - is the possibility of moments when what we have chosen and what we desire are the same. Such a convergence obviously cannot be continuous. No relationship can continue very long at its highest emotional pitch. But fidelity prepares us for the return of these moments, which give us the highest joy we can know; that of union, communion, atonement (in the root sense of at-one-ment)...
To forsake all others does not mean - because it cannot mean - to ignore or neglect all others, to hide or be hidden from all others, or to desire or love no others. To live in marriage is a responsible way to live in sexuality, as to live in a household is a responsible way to live in the world. One cannot enact or fulfill one's love for womankind or mankind, or even for all the women or men to whom one is attracted. If one is to have the power and delight of one's sexuality, then the generality of instinct must be resolved in a responsible relationship to a particular person. Similarly, one cannot live in the world; that is, one cannot become, in the easy, generalizing sense with which the phrase is commonly used, a "world citizen." There can be no such think as a "global village." No matter how much one may love the world as a whole, one can live fully in it only by living responsibly in some small part of it. Where we live and who we live there with define the terms of our relationship to the world and to humanity. We thus come again to the paradox that one can become whole only by the responsible acceptance of one's partiality.
(pg.117-118, "The Body and the Earth")”



“He feared me as many men fear women: because their mistresses (or their wives) understand them. They are scarcely adult, some men: they wish women to understand them, and to that end they tell them all their secrets; and then, when they are properly understood, they hate their women for understanding them.”



“He carries stars in his pockets
because he knows
she fears the dark.
Whenever sadness pays her a visit
he paints galaxies
on the back of her hands.”



“Marriage as a long conversation. - When marrying you should ask yourself this question: do you believe you are going to enjoy talking with this woman into your old age? Everything else in a marriage is transitory, but most of the time that you're together will be devoted to conversation.”



“I was trying to decide if you still had free will as a wolf. If I was a terrible person for planning to drug my girlfriend and drag her back to my house to keep in the basement.”



“So many events and moments that seemed insignificant add up. I remember how for the last Valentine´s Day, N gave flowers but no card. In restaurants, he looked off into the middle distance while my hand would creep across the table to hold his. He would always let go first. I realize I can´t remember his last spontaneous gesture of affection.”



“She knew that what she was going through was nothing special, just garden-variety heartbreak, the sort of thing that poets and novelists had been writing about for hundreds of years, but she also knew, from those same books, that there were people who never recover form it, ones who go on through life beset by a dim and painful longing.”

“Eve: “If you ended up naked and dead with another woman, I'd do the Rumba on your corpse.”
Roarke: “You can't do the Rumba.”
Eve: “I'd take lessons first.”
Roarke: “You might very well. Not that you'll ever get the chance, but you'd also grieve.”
Eve: “Wouldn't give you the satisfaction. You cheating f-wit putz. "
Roarke: “You'd weep in the dark and call my name.”
Eve: “Call your name alright. How are things in hell? You dickless bastard. And I'd laugh and laugh, that's how I''d call your name.”
Roarke: “Christ Jesus Eve, I love you.”
--Eve, Roarke”



“I had a dream about you last night. I was alone on a dark night and you came to me as a firefly. I knew it was you because you were the brightest.”



“I live for sex.
I celebrate it, and relish the electricity of it, with every fibre of my being.
I can see no better reason for being alive.”



“Men have sacrificed and crippled themselves physically and emotionally to feed, house, and protect women and children. None of their pain or achievement is registered in feminist rhetoric, which portrays men as oppressive and callous exploiters.”

“Trying to fall out of love is like trying to climb a mountain. Blindfolded, on crutches, naked in a hail storm.”

“I look back to where my life had been. It's always risky to think of letting go. That's why this is the perfect ending. Nothing left to reconcile.”



“Some people don’t realize what they have until it’s gone, but that does not always mean they are supposed to get it back.”

“...he prayed fundamentally as a gesture of love for what had gone and would go and could be loved in no other way. When he prayed he touched his parents, who could not otherwise be touched, and he touched a feeling that we are all children who lose our parents, all of us, every man and woman and boy and girl, and we too will all be lost by those who come after us and love us, and this loss unites humanity, unites every human being, the temporary nature of our being-ness, and our shared sorrow, the heartache we each carry and yet too often refuse to acknowledge in one another, and out of this Saeed felt it might be possible, in the face of death, to believe in humanity's potential for building a better world, so he prayed as a lament, as a consolation, and as a hope....”



“You cold or something?' he said. She strained against him; she wanted to pass clear through him: 'It's a chill, it's nothing'; and then, pushing a little away: 'Say you love me.'
I said it.'
No, oh no. You haven't. I was listening. And you never do.'
Well, give me time.'
Please.'
He sat up and glanced at a clock across the room. It was after five. Then decisively he pulled off his windbreaker and began to unlace his shoes.
Aren't you going to, Clyde?'
He grinned back at her. 'Yeah, I'm going to.'
I don't mean that; and what's more, I don't like it: you sound as though you were talking to a whore.'
Come off it, honey. You didn't drag me up here to tell you about love.'
You disgust me,' she said.
Listen to her! She's sore!'
A silence followed that circulated like an aggrieved bird. Clyde said, 'You want to hit me, huh? I kind of like you when you're sore: that's the kind of girl you are,' which made Grady light in his arms when he lifted and kissed her. 'You still want me to say it?' Her head slumped on his shoulder. 'Because I will,' he said, fooling his fingers in her hair. 'Take off your clothes--and I'll tell it to you good.”



“I never tell my boyfriend that I'm busy when I'm not. No matter how effective they are, cheap techniques like that just don't agree with me. So it's always okay, it's always all right. In my opinion the surest way to hook a man is to be as open with him as possible.”



“You’re not a bad person, you’re just a little bit different and I’m a sucker for that.”

“Women and men who have established no-lie relationships talk about them with reverence, even when they are not permanent and, in fact, even when they are not romantic. Why? In the no-lie relationship there is acceptance of who each partner is, rather than a shallow idealization. There is a genuine commitment to the relationship beyond the immediate. You each act as though you are in a real partnership that will last.”



“Often we take personally the slings and arrows of our 'abusers'. But frequently we are merely the interchangeable pawns of their own neurotic dramas. Anyone else in your position would have received the same treatment. There is nothing especially noxious or negatively noteworthy about you.”



“With the cure, relationships are all the same, and rules and expectations are defined. Without the cure, relationships must be reinvented every day, languages constantly decoded and deciphered. Freedom is exhausting.”



“But isn’t being alone closer to the truest version of ourselves, when we’re not linked to another, not diluted by their presence and judgments? We form relationships with others, friends, family. That’s fine. Those relationships don’t bind the way love does. We can still have lovers, short-term. But only when alone can we focus on ourselves, know ourselves. How can we know ourselves without this solitude?”



“You can argue that it's a different world now than the one when Matthew Shepard was killed, but there is a subtle difference between tolerance and acceptance. It's the distance between moving into the cul-de-sac and having your next door neighbor trust you to keep an eye on her preschool daughter for a few minutes while she runs out to the post office. It's the chasm between being invited to a colleague's wedding with your same-sex partner and being able to slow-dance without the other guests whispering.”



“I love you," he said, his voice catching. "When I thought you were going to die, I wanted to die.”



“Proper apologies have three parts:
1) What I did was wrong.
2) I feel badly that I hurt you.
3) How do I make this better?”



“This is new to us, you know? Your mother's sorry. She's sorry that she hurt your feelings, and she wants you to invite your girlfriend over for dinner."
"So that she can make her feel bad and weird?"
"Well she is kind of weird, isn't she?"
Park didn't have the energy to be angry. He sighed and let his head fall back on the chair.
His dad kept talking. "Isn't that why you like her?”



“I'm in a foreign land, trying to explain myself, trying to make myself known. Because isn't that the point of every relationship: to be known by someone else, to be understood? He gets me. She gets me. Isn't that the simple magic phrase?”



“I had a dream about you. You were lost in a daydream, when I walked in and you began screaming. But I know that could never actually happen. In real life I only enter people’s nightmares.”



“A beautiful thing happens when we start paying attention to each other. It is by participating more in your relationship that you breathe life into it.”




“I don't deserve you. I'm not made for relationships. I know I'm going to fuck this up. I'm going to drive you away or do something to hurt you, and you'll be added to my list of people I screwed over. You should walk away now.”



“Solid character will reflect itself in consistent behavior, while poor character will seek to hide behind deceptive words and actions.”



“You don't fix a man the way you do a fault in a pipe or a leak in a roof. You take him as he is, Mary Brenna, or you don't take him at all...adjustments can't be all made on one side, darling, else the balance goes off and what's being built just falls down.”



“I pictured Cupid sitting in a crappy little bar, drunk and depressed, while he moaned to the bartender, "That Jasmine Parks,
gods
, she pisses me off! Did you see what she just did? Totally blew off this immortal stud to play kiss-the-boo-boo with a fickle little rent-a-cop. Why? 'Cause she's the biggest chickenshit on the planet! I'm ready to toss my bow and pick up a bazooka!”



“She never got a chance to fall out of love, to do it properly, slowly and thoroughly, and the result was he was like a phantom limb. Gone but still there. And like a true phantom limb, the preponderance of feelings associated with him were painful.”

“It was completely fifth garde and completely silly and I loved it, because he wasn't afraid to be silly. It was like kissing him first - I could do whatever I wanted and not have to worry what he'd think of me.”



“[Marriage] happens as with cages: the birds without despair to get in, and those within despair of getting out.”



“We kissed each other until we were too tired to keep going. I could still feel him holding back. It was my penance for what I had done to him. All I could do was hope the walls would fall and that I could have all of him again, but I was always leaving and he was tired of watching me walk away. We both knew that I couldn’t stay and that he couldn’t come with me, but still, we couldn’t let go.”



“Pundits are always blaming TV for making people stupid, movies for desensitizing the world to violence, and rock music for making kids take drugs and kill themselves. These things should be the least of our worries. The main problem with mass media is that it makes it impossible to fall in love with any acumen of normalcy. There is no 'normal,' because everybody is being twisted by the same sources simultaneously. ”



“..I find it incredible impossible not to cry when I hear Stevie Nicks's "Landslide," especially the lyric: "I've been afraid of changing, because I've built my life around you." I think a good test to see if a human is actually a robot/android/cylon is to have them listen to this song lyric and study their reaction. If they don't cry, you should stab them through the heart. You will find a fusebox.”

“Love is something you do for someone else, not something you do for yourself.”



“All's fair in love and war," said Ron brightly, "and this is a bit of both.”



“A family can be the bane of one's existence. A family can also be most of the meaning of one's existence. I don't know whether my family is bane or meaning, but they have surely gone away and left a large hole in my heart.”



“In all my close friendships, words are the bricks I use to build bridges. To know someone I need to hear her, and to feel known, I need to be heard by her. The process of knowing and loving another person happens for me through conversation. I reveal something to help my friend understand me, she responds in a way that assures me she values my revelation, and then she adds something to help me understand her. This back-and-forth is repeated again and again as we go deeper into each other's hearts, minds, pasts, and dreams. Eventually, a friendship is built - a solid, sheltering structure that exists in the space between us - a space outside of ourselves that we can climb deep into. There is her, there is me, and then there is our friendship - this bridge we've built together.”



“I have never bought into the idea that blood is thicker than water. Love and respect are meant to be earned from our children, our spouses, our families, and our friends.”



“It's always hard to remember love - years pass and you say to yourself, Was I really in love, or was I just kidding myself? Was I really in love, or was I just pretending he was the man of my dreams? Was I really in love, or was I just desperate?”



“Maybe love was meant to save us from ourselves.”

“Prince or commoner, tenor or bass,
Painter or plumber or never-do-well,
Do me a favor and shut your face -
Poets alone should kiss and tell.”



“She wildly burned for the one she loved and he stood there watching, hoping he too would catch a blaze from the violence stirring in her heart.”

“Love grows from stable relationships, shared experience, loyalty, devotion, trust.”

“Everyday it gets easier to connect with an electronic device that it is to connect with real people.”

“Love falls in love with love;
comes like an echo sounding back,
searches its mirrored shadow
within a look. ”

“I had a dream about you last night. I could fly. I was going to use this power to impress you, but you were too heavy to carry, so I won you over with my personality instead”



“If the sound of happy children is grating on your ears, I don't think it's the children who need to be adjusted.”

“I took it for granted that there must be a few men left in the world who had that kind of strength. I assumed that those men would also be looking for women with principle. I did not want to be among the marked-down goods on the bargain table, cheap because they’d been pawed over. Crowds collect there. It is only the few who will pay full price. "You get what you pay for.”



“You know your problem, Quentin? You keep expecting people not to be themselves.”



“The more things we accumulate, the more cluttered our lives become, and the more stressed we feel as we are compelled to think about them. Life is about people not about things.”

“I had a dream about you last night. The best day of my life was when I taught you how to juggle, but the best day of yours was when you taught someone else.”



“I had a dream about you last night.. You were playing with chicken livers and told me everyone was in quarantine.”



“He thought about this for a second. "True. But if you never really make friends, you probably don't have anyone to be your 2 a.m. Which would kind of suck.
I just looked at him as he stirred his soup, carrots spinning in the liquid. "Your what?"
"Two a.m." He swallowed, then said, "You know. The person you can call at two a.m. and, no matter what, you can count on them. Even if they're asleep or it's cold or you need to be bailed out of jail...they'll come for you. It's, like, the highest level of friendship.”




“How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw.”



“The girl was grateful to the young man for every bit of flattery; she wanted to linger for a moment in its warmth and so she said, 'You're very good at lying.'
'Do I look like a liar?'
'You look like you enjoy lying to women,' said the girl, and into her words there crept unawares a touch of the old anxiety, because she really did believe that her young man enjoyed lying to women.”



“Every broken heart has screamed at one time or another: Why can't you see who I truly am?”

“In your pursuit of your passions, always be young. In your relationship with others, always be grown-up. ”

“Every incident chips away at your limit. Every time you choose to stay, it makes the next time that much harder to leave. Eventually, you lose sight of your limit altogether, because you start to think, ‘I’ve lasted five years now. What’s five more?”



“He is your friend who pushes you nearer to God.”

“she was completely whole
and yet never fully complete”



“I Love Loving You
You are my favorite song; a rhythm of beauty that captures my spirit.
You are my favorite poem; an exquisite grouping of ideas set in motion with an unmatched enchanting elegance.
You are my best friend; from our laughter to our deep conversations, our moments together are a timeless pleasure.
You are my soul mate; a connection so pure, so powerful, that it can only be considered divine.
You are my lover; a passionate entwinement, a chorus of ecstasy, and a feeling of complete unity that words could never adequately describe.
You are my angel; you remind me of the goodness in this world and inspire me to be the greatest version of myself.
You are my home; it is in your loving gaze that I find the comfort, acceptance, and the sense of belonging.
You are my love ~ mi amor; there are not enough days in forever to allow me to fully express my love for you.
I love loving you.”



“Ask anyone and they'll most likely say their family is crazy, and if they don't say their family is crazy, their friends are crazy. That's because everyone is crazy after taking the mask off. People are most themselves when not really trying to fit in, when either alone or around those already closest to them, and that is crazy.”



“I need you because I know I deserve you but let me fall in love with you one last time before I let go. So I can remember the beautiful imperfection that rattled my bones.”

“My heart is burning a hole in my chest and every time you speak to me, it keeps sinking, and I'm left with nothing but ashes. I wish she were talking to me, because the more she speaks to me, the more my heart flutters like a rising phoenix.
-Karen Quan and Jarod Kintz”



“We need to bridge our sense of loneliness and disconnection with a sense of community and continuity even if we must manufacture it from our time on the Web and our use of calling cards to connect long distance. We must “log on” somewhere, and if it is only in cyberspace, that is still far better than nowhere at all. (264)”



“Just because a relationship ends, it doesn't mean it's not worth having.”



“And the terrible thing, the terrible thing is, but the good thing too, the saving grace, is that if something happened to one of us--excuse me for saying this--but if something happened to one of us tomorrow, I think the other one, the other person, would grieve for a while, you know, but then the surviving party would go out and love again, have someone else soon enough. All this, all of this love we're talking about, it would just be a memory. Maybe not even a memory.”



“Emotional predictive profiling may help identify contingent fissures in the stature of endangered relationships. Still and all, it might be wise to let the genie out of problematic bottles in the first place, in advance of scouting the causes of surreptitious subliminal convulsions. ("Beware of the neighbor")”

“Love spiritually, not strategically.”



“I despise my own hypersensitiveness, which requires so much reassurance. It is certainly abnormal to crave so much to be loved and understood.”

“Friendships are nice. So is competence.”



“She had more of me then I had of myself. We were both wild birds chasing the stars. We’d lose our way and find new places, close our eyes and fall back towards a constellation of dreams. We wrapped ourselves in a blanket of passion and each night we fell deeper without control, into this strange space called love.”

“It's unexpectedly painful to have become a pronoun.”



“Soul mates. They really call themselves that, which makes sense, because I guess they are ... They have no harsh edges with each other, no spiny conflicts, they ride though life like conjoined jellyfish - expanding and contracting instinctively, filling each other's spaces liquidly. Making it look easy.”



“Life is like butter - when things cool down it can be reshaped”



“A good place to meet a man is at the dry cleaner. These men usually have jobs and bathe.”

“The best baby-sitters, of course, are the baby’s grandparents. You feel completely comfortable entrusting your baby to them for long periods, which is why most grandparents flee to Florida.”

“I want to take all our best moments, put them in a jar, and take them out like cookies and savor each one of them forever.”



“Bloody men are like bloody buses —
You wait for about a year
And as soon as one approaches your stop
Two or three others appear.
You look at them flashing their indicators,
Offering you a ride.
You’re trying to read the destinations,
You haven’t much time to decide.
If you make a mistake, there is no turning back.
Jump off, and you’ll stand there and gaze
While the cars and the taxis and lorries go by
And the minutes, the hours, the days.”



“The best defense is a confusing offense.”



“Shall there be truth between us, as two men? Not as friends, but as enemies and equals?”



“I had a dream about you last night. We watched pornography together, but purely for the storyline.”



“He doesn’t have to love your CD collection. He doesn’t have to love your shoes. But any good, mature guy better make an attempt to love your friends and family—especially when they’re great.”




“You mistake love. You think it has to have a future in order to matter, but it doesn't. It's the only thing that does not need to become at all. It matters only insofar as it exists. Here. Now. Love doesn't require a future.”



“Do not hold your breath for anyone,
Do not wish your lungs to be still,
It may delay the cracks from spreading,
But eventually they will.
Sometimes to keep yourself together
You must allow yourself to leave,
Even if breaking your own heart
Is what it takes to let you breathe.”

“There’s nothing like that feeling of waiting for a guy. It’s the loneliest feeling in the world. Holding that cell phone in your hand as you take out the trash, use the bathroom, change the litter box. Fearful that the one second you aren’t looking will be when they call. Pathetic. And something I have done as recently as last week.”



“But dear, don’t be afraid of love it’s only magic.”

“We are one of those couples i used to watch, thinking to myself that I'd never be on the inside of something so special. I remember reassuring myself that it probably looked nicer than it actually was, I am happy to be wrong about that.”



“Oh for God's sake,' Heather said, 'I wish you two would just go out, fail miserably as a couple, and get it over with.”



“A man can know his father, or his son, and there might still be nothing between them but loyalty and love and mutual incomprehension.”



“When she was younger, she felt that he wanted to know everything about her, but she was sometimes afraid to tell too much. She was afraid he would know her too well, that he would find some weakness in her, some element that would turn him away, maybe even a quality she didn't even realize she possessed.”

“Needy people are like newborns, I have come to realize. One intoxicated night and BAM! You are stuck with this problem. You finally take it home and it wants to keep you up all night and cries when it isn’t sucking on various parts of your anatomy. It wants you there for everything – rocking, feeding, burping, changing... It’s ridiculous. If I wanted a kid I would have one. Until then, grow the hell up and stand on your own two feet, you little crazy.”

“That guys. Sideburns. You like him?"
My back squirms. "You've asked me that before."
"What I meant was," he says, flustered. "Your feelings haven't changed? Since you've been here?"
It takes a moment to consider the question. "It's not a matter of how
I
feel," I say at last. "I'm interested, but ... I don't know if he's still interested in me."
St. Clair edges closer. "Does he still call?"
"Yeah. I mean, not often. But yes."
"Right. Right, well," he says, blinking. "There's your answer.”



“Women that can work a camera with ease often work men just as effortlessly for both require the same commitment to vanity and manipulation.”

“If we are to feel the positive feelings of love, happiness, trust, and gratitude, we periodically also have to feel anger, sadness, fear, and sorrow.”



“Everyone creates realities based on their own personal beliefs. These beliefs are so powerful that they can create [expansive or entrapping] realities over and over.~Kuan Yin”



“Give a man a centimeter and he'll think he's a ruler.”



“It's easy to like someone from a distance. But when she stopped being this amazing unattainable thing or whatever, and started being, like, just a regular girl with a weird relationship with food and frequent crankiness wh's kind of bossy--then I had to basically start liking a whole different person.”

“Love doesn't erase the past, but it makes the future different.”



“You're walking funny," Lucy said, a shit-eating grin on her face. Five days of out of this world sex with a starving man could do that to a girl.

"You're just jealous." Brenna pushed through the door into DarkRiver's business HQ.
Lucy made a mournful face. "Yes, I am. Goddamn but your man is hot. And he smiles at you! I've seen him do it, even if no one believes me.”



“Winter is much like unrequited love; cold and merciless.”

“You’re a mess, I confess, I despise you in the best kind of way.”

“To feel aroused is to feel alive. Having great sex is like taking in huge lungfuls of fresh air, essential to your body, essential to your health, and essential to your life.”



“Despite the fact that I have no regrets about how things turned out in my life, I still can't help wanting to understand my intense relationship with Leo, as well as that turbulent time between adolescence and adulthood when everything feels raw and invigorating and scary-and why those feelings are all coming back to me now.”



“Tanith frowned. Did people still go on DATES any more? She was sure they did. They probably called it something different though. She tried to think of the last date she'd been on. The last PROPER date. Did fighting side by side with Saracen Rue count as a date? They ended up snuggling under the moonlight, drenched in gore and pieces of brain - so it had PROBABLY been a date. If it wasn't, it was certainly a fun time had by all. Well, not ALL. But she and Saracen had sure had a blast.”



“Relationship gurus always said that an attraction based on friendship and mutual respect was far more likely to stay the course - and the bastards were right.”



“Understand the nature and influence of repeating patterns, from childhood experiences or even from past lives. Wthout understanding, patterns tend to repeat, unnecessarily damaging the relationship.”



“He was everything your mother warned you about when she told you not to walk alone in the dark.”



“Why?' He asked.
'Why what?' What could I say? Noah, despite you being an asshole, or maybe because of it, I'd like to rip off your clothes and have your babies. Don't tell.”



“Uh-uh, dude. I tried it your way with the dating and the girls and the kissing and the drama, and man, I didn't like it. Plus, my best friend is a walking cautionary tale of what happens to you when romantic relationships don't involve marriage. Like you always say, kafir, everything ends in breakup, divorce, or death. I want to narrow my misery options to divorce or death - that's all.”



“Just remember that the only question in a house is who is to rule. The rest is only dancing around that, trying not to look it in the eye.”



“Hereafter she is only my sister in name; not because I disown her, but because she has disowned me.”



“Because you let our love just fall apart
You no longer have my heart”

“Your first impulse is to share good news, your second is to club someone with it.”




“We look down our noses at people who've made mistakes in relationships. She's so stupid! How could she do that! Our superiority makes us feel better. But I’d bet everything I have on the fact that people to claim to have a perfect record in love are either lying or have very limited dating experience. People who say, I’d never do that! Someday, unless you are very, very lucky, you’ll have a story to tell. Or not to tell.”



“All of them, all except Phineas, constructed at infinite cost to themselves these Maginot Lines against this enemy they thought they saw across the frontier, this enemy who never attacked that way—if he ever attacked at all; if he was indeed the enemy.”

“Because he could not afford to fail, he could not afford to trust.”



“We had been friends. We could not become strangers. It left only one thing: we must be enemies.”



“Scholars, theologians, and even poets have yet to be able to truly describe and touch upon the beauty, romance, and magic of a relationship built on 100% authenticity”



“The snag about marriage is, it isn´t worth the divorce.”



“I guess it can’t be too often that two people can laugh and make love, too, make love because they are laughing, laugh because they’re making love. The love and the laughter come from the same place: but not many people go there”



“They (penguins) then fall madly in love and live happily ever after.
-
And so you ask yourself: "If a penguin can have a worthwhile, stimulating relationship, why the hell can't I?"
-
Or maybe you ask yourself: "Would I be happier if I started dating a penguin”



“Please don’t hate you??!! I hate that I love you. Loving you made me waste a year of my life. Loving
you made me be passionate about nothing but you. Loving you made me take risks I never would have
otherwise. Loving you made me give it up to you. Loving you made me neglect my parents and Amy.
Loving you made me not care that my grandma just died. Loving you made me turn out bitter and
hopeless like her. Loving you made me hate myself for being dumped by you. Loving you made me
deluded, irrational, inconsiderate, and a liar. And because I love you, you’re always going to haunt me.”



“Love me like a wrong turn on a bad road
late at night.”

“There is no formula to relationships. They have to be negotiated in loving ways, with room for both parties, what they want and what they need, what they can do and what their life is like. In business, people negotiate to win. They negotiate to get what they want. Maybe you’re too used to that. Love is different. Love is when you are as concerned about someone else’s situation as you are about your own.”

“I think we go well together. I like being with you because I'm never bored. Even when we're not talking, even when we're not touching, even when we're not in the same room, I'm not bored. I'm never bored. I think it's because I have confidence in you, in your thoughts. Do you understand? I love everything I see in you, and everything I don't see. I know your faults, but as it turns out, I feel as though your faults go well with my qualities. We're not afraid of the same things. Even our inner demons go well together! You, you're worth more than you show...”



“We do not have to be mental health professionals to identify the traits of the possible sociopaths among us.”



“When you've been around as long as me, Lucy, you'll know that there are three types of sex... One - brand-new, kitchen-table sex. Two - bedroom sex. Then number three - hallway sex, when you pass each other in the hallway and say 'Fuck you.'" - Lockie”



“I will never claim to know what you are thinking. I only hope I am on your mind.”



“You know why people pair up into couples? Because being a human is fucking terrifying. But it's a hell of a lot easier if you're not doing it by yourself.”



“Someone asked me about the difference between love and lust. Hmmm. That will take a little thought. How to tell the difference? Well, for guys, if she looks better AFTER you've made love to her than before, that might be love. If you find yourself itching to get out the door afterward, probably just lust, y'know?”

“But the coconut is also a symbol of resilience, Samar. Even in the conditions where there's very little nourishment and even less nurturance, it flourishes, growing taller than most of the plants around it.”



“There is nothing more beautiful than a vulnerable heart in open hands.”



“Family, friends and relationships are the blessings of the God. They are the best way to access God.”



“This is one of the marks of a truly safe person: they are confrontable.”



“Death ends a life, not a relationship.”

“Evaluating the benefits and drawbacks of any relationship is your responsibility. You do not have to passively accept what is brought to you. You can choose.”

“The demand to be safe in relationship inevitably breeds sorrow and fear. This seeking for security is inviting insecurity. Have you ever found security in any of your relationships? Have you? Most of us want the security of loving and being loved, but is there love when each one of us is seeking his own security, his own particular path? We are not loved because we don't know how to love.”



“Both men and women today see marriage not as a way of creating character and community but as a way to reach personal life goals. They are looking for a marriage partner who will 'fulfill their emotional, sexual, and spiritual desires.' And that creates an extreme idealism that in turn leads to a deep pessimism that you will ever find the right person to marry.”



“Do you know how it hurts to touch you
knowing that in the morning I’ll still wake up alone?”

“- Ты хочешь знать, как быть, если сделал что-то не так? Отвечаю, детка: никогда не проси прощения. Ничего не говори. Посылай цветы. Без писем. Только цветы. Они покрывают все. Даже могилы.”



“What's the use of complaining about something you have no intentions of changing it?”

“Shame isn't a strong enough word for what I feel.
"You could live a hundred lifetimes and not deserve him, you know," Haymitch says.”




“Those who take lightly promises they make to those they love are people who find little lasting satisfaction in life. This is not an easy time in which to live. That does not mean that it has to be a difficult time to love, but it does mean that you will find unusual stresses upon your lives and your relationship.”



“Most people think everybody feels about them much more violently than they actually do; they think other people's opinions of them swing through great arcs of approval or disapproval.”



“On the left side of a strong woman, stands a strong man; he is strengthened by her character.”

“She couldn't be on his wavelength all the time. That's all. When you could recognize that and deal with it, you were on your way to an adult relationship.”



“Don't. Don't let's pretend when there's no one around.”



“Still, she knows one thing for certain: never judge a relationship unless you are the one wrapped up in its arms.”



“They feel life is for the taking, and that everyone deserves happiness no matter what the cost. I must remember these tricks if I ever decide to have my soul surgically removed.”



“Sure am glad I'm not royalty," I muttered. "I wouldn't want to have to bump uglies with someone I can't stand. On a regular basis. And no one else."
"Ow!" I exclaimed, trying to yank my fingers from Trent but finding them caught. Then I colored, realizing what I'd said. "Oh… sorry," I stammered, meaning it. "That was insensitive."
Trent's frown turned into a sly smirk. "Bump uglies?" he said, eyes on the table behind me. "You are a font of gutter slang, Rachel. We must do this again.”



“I look at him with the nostalgic affection men are said to feel for their wars, their fellow veterans. I think, I once threw things at this man. I threw a glass ashtray, a fairly cheap one which didn't break. I threw a shoe (his) and a handbag (mine), not even snapping the handbag shut first, so that he was showered with a metal rain of keys and small change. The worst thing I threw was a small portable television set, standing on the bed and heaving it at him with the aid of the bouncy springs, although the instant I let fly I thought, Oh God, let him duck! I once thought I was capable of murdering him. Today I feel only a mild regret that we were not more civilized with each other at the time. Still, it was amazing, all those explosions, that recklessness, that Technicolor wreckage. Amazing and agonizing and almost lethal.”



“Hearts set about finding other hearts the moment they are born, and between them, they weave nets so frightfully strong and tight that you end up bound forever in hopeless knots, even to the shadow of a beast you knew and loved long ago.”



“Someday I will have revenge. I know in advance to keep this to myself, and everyone will be happier. I do understand that I am expected to forgive N and his girlfriend in a timely fashion, and move on to a life of vegetarian cooking and difficult yoga positions and self-realization, and make this so much easier and more pleasant for all concerned.”



“The aching in my chest
isn't because I miss you,
it's realizing that you have
become someone I no longer know,
your fears, your 4 am thoughts,
your achievements,
are things I no longer have an equivalent to.
Who we were and who we are
are four different people,
and the me from now
doesn't relate to the me from then,
let alone to the you from now.
-Tanzy Sayadi and Jarod Kintz”



“It's as if every conversation with a woman was a test, and men always failed it, because they always lacked the key to the code and so they never quite understood what the conversation was really about.”



“Surprises, I feel now, are primarily a form of violence.”



“Alright, good night,” he said, his words a little slurred. “But before I pass out, I want you to know that you’re the hottest biscuit this side of the gravy boat.”



“For you she learned to wear a short black slip
and red lipstick,
how to order a glass of red wine
and finish it. She learned to reach out
as if to touch your arm and then not
touch it, changing the subject.
Didn't you think,
she'd begin, or
Weren't you sorry. . . .
To call your best friends
by their schoolboy names
and give them kisses good-bye,
to look away when they say
Your wife
! So your confidence grows.
She doesn't ask what you want
because she knows.
Isn't that what you think?
When actually she was only waiting
to be told
Take off your dress---
to be stunned, and then do this,
never rehearsed, but perfectly obvious:
in one motion up, over, and gone,
the X of her arms crossing and uncrossing,
her face flashing away from you in the fabric
so that you couldn't say if she was
appearing or disappearing.”



“I love you as the mother of my child": the kiss of death.
Mother of His Child: demotion. I am beginning to see this truism: Mothers are not always wives. I have been stripped of a piece of self.”



“Everybody deserves love, but nobody is entitled to it.”

“He announces that lately he keeps losing things. "Like your wife and child," I want to say, but don´t. At fourty, I´ve learned not to say everything clever, not to score every point.”



“You could say that Elphaba brought us together,' said Boq softly. 'I'm closer to her and so I'm closer to you.'
Galinda seemed to give up. She leaned her head back on the velvet cushions of the swing and said, 'Boq, you know despite myself I think you're a little sweet. You're a little sweet and you're a little charming and you're a little maddening and you're a little habit-forming.'
Boq held his breath.
But you're little!' she concluded. 'You're a Munchkin, for god's sake!'
He kissed her, he kissed her, he kissed her, little by little by little.”



“Watching him with one eye, she wondered if men ever figured out that they were more appealing when they were pursuing their own work than when they were pursuing a woman.”



“That’s always seemed so ridiculous to me, that people would want to be around someone because they’re pretty. It’s like picking your breakfast cereals based on color instead of taste.”



“That chain of relationships made me think of how connections are made--you read a book, you meet a person, you have a single experience, and your life is changed in some way. No act, therefore, however small, should be dismissed or ignored.”



“Relationships are so much like the United States - they only really thrive when faced with an external threat.”



“What's your definition of dating?
Lengthy social time spent with a woman during which we're not actively fucking”



“The old Amy, the girl of the big laugh and the easy ways, literally shed herself, a pile of skin and soul on the floor, and stepped this new, brittle, bitter Amy ... a razor-wire knot daring me to unloop her, and I was not up to the job with my thick, numb, nervous fingers. Country fingers. Flyover fingers untrained in the intricate, dangerous work of 'solving Amy'. When I'd hold up the bloody stumps, she'd sigh and turn to her secret mental notebooks on which she tallied all my deficiencies, forever noting disappointments, frailties, shortcomings.”



“I don't know, maybe you'd be more interested in me if I were a book.”



“Love and honesty don’t mix.”



“The first time someone I loved left me behind...I didn't know how my family would balance. We had been such a sturdy little end table, four solid legs. I was sure we would now be off-kilter, always unstable. Until one day I looked more closely, and realized that we had simply become a stool.”



“time made me stronger, you're no longer on my mind”

“I think what I want is for someone to know me. Really know me. Know me better than anyone else and maybe even me. Isn’t that why we commit to another? It’s not for sex. If it were for sex, we wouldn’t marry one person. We’d just keep finding new partners. We commit for many reasons, I know, but the more I think about it, the more I think long-term relationships are for getting to know someone. I want someone to know me, really know me, almost like that person could get into my head. What would that feel like? To have access, to know what it’s like in someone else’s head. To rely on someone else, have him rely on you. That’s not a biological connection like the one between parents and children. This kind of relationship would be chosen. It would be something cooler, harder to achieve than one built on biology and shared genetics. I think that’s it. Maybe that’s how we know when a relationship is real. When someone else previously unconnected to us knows us in a way we never thought or believed possible.”




“You can't truly hate someone until you've cared about them. Until you've loved them.”



“Sometimes our walls exist just to see who has the strength to knock
them down.”



“You've got an awfully kissable mouth.”



“I've found that when you're wrapped up in the process of dating and want so badly to have something work out with someone -anyone- it's easy to forget that your choices aren't limited to one person or the other. There's also the choice I always forget about: To not choose anyone in order to keep myself open to someone who IS right for me.”



“We can't be so desperate for love that we forget where we can always find it; within.”

“But it became clear very quickly that I'd underestimated how much I liked him. Not him, perhaps, but the fact that I had someone on the other end of an invisible line. Someone to update and get updates from, to inform of a comic discovery, to imagine while dancing in a lonely basement, and to return to, finally, when the music stopped.”



“You know a relationship has deteriorated past the point of salvage when one person detests another's gestures.”



“Here was a boy who liked flaws, who saw them not as failings but as strengths. Who knew such a person could exist, or what would have happened if we'd found each other under different circumstances? Maybe in a perfect world. But not in this one.”



“Sometimes it's exhausting for me to simply walk into the house. I try and calm myself, remember that I've lived alone before. Sleeping by myself didn't kill me then and will not kill me now. But this what loss has taught me of love. Our house isn't simply
empty
, our home
has been emptied
. Love makes a place in your life, it makes a place for itself in your bed. Invisibly, it makes a place in your body, rerouting all your blood vessels, throbbing right alongside your heart. When it's gone, nothing is whole again.”



“Living together/ is one move closer/ to living apart”

“I am looking for the one I can’t fool.”

“my only complaints are two:
that I didn't make myself ready
for you sooner in life, that
I can't give you better,
Love you more.”

“Hating hurts the hater the most. Hating is not a salve for the wounded soul, it is an abrasive that keeps the soul wounded and raw and oversensitive.”

“You might think that a boy is just your friend, but then if you find out that maybe he likes you (in a boyfriend way), everything changes instantly. (47)”



“You will be a great queen when you come back, you know. And someday you'll love me the way you love your wolf.”



“That's one of the first things that comes out of young people's mouths when they're in love. FOREVER. And that's cool, it's all good-until you get old enough to realize what forever is.”



“[On what young husbands should say to their wives:] I have taken you in my arms, and I love you, and I prefer you to my life itself. For the present life is nothing, and my most ardent dream is to spend it with you in such a way that we may be assured of not being separated in the life reserved for us... I place your love above all things, and nothing would be more bitter or painful to me than to be of a different mind than you.”

“Fighting doesn’t feel good anymore. It feels like breaking something because you don’t know how to fix it.”



“If you haven't cried at least once while writing a chapter of your inspirational book, then you have to ask yourself if your're writing fiction.”

“I wonder if it is possible to have two boyfriends. I mean, times are changing. Relationships are more complicated. In France men always have mistresses and wives and so on. Henri probably has two girlfriends. He would laugh if you told him you just had one. He would say,
'C'est tres, tres tragique.'
”



“Every broken heart has screamed at one time or another, "I want to know why!”

“Star friendship.— We were friends and have become estranged. But this was right, and we do not want to conceal and obscure it from ourselves as if we had reason to feel ashamed. We are two ships each of which has its goal and course; our paths may cross and we may celebrate a feast together, as we did—and then the good ships rested so quietly in one harbor and one sunshine that it may have looked as if they had reached their goal and as if they had one goal. But then the almighty force of our tasks drove us apart again into different seas and sunny zones, and perhaps we shall never see one another again,—perhaps we shall meet again but fail to recognize each other: our exposure to different seas and suns has changed us! That we have to become estranged is the law above us: by the same token we should also become more venerable for each other! And thus the memory of our former friendship should become more sacred! There is probably a tremendous but invisible stellar orbit in which our very different ways and goals may be included as small parts of this path,—let us rise up to this thought! But our life is too short and our power of vision too small for us to be more than friends in the sense of this sublime possibility.— Let us then believe in our star friendship even if we should be compelled to be earth enemies.”



“A balanced inner calmness radiates from a peaceful centre. It neither craves others' approval nor rejects others' presence. It neither pulls towards nor pushes away. It has a reverent attitude towards life and all its inhabitants.”



“Just because you discover that you may like somebody after all, it doesn't necessarily mean there's any attraction.”

“The day he moved out was terrible –
That evening she went through hell.
His absence wasn’t a problem
But the corkscrew had gone as well.”



“I had a dream about you last night.. You were balancing ten tiny footballs on your nose while dancing with a turquoise unicorn.”



“I had a dream about you last night... you kept meowing at people and licking yourself it was not unlike you normally.”



“Anyway, you can't leave her like that. You can't do that to the woman. She doesn't deserve it; nobody does. You don't belong to her and she doesn't belong to you, but you're both part of each other; if she got up and left now and walked away and you never saw each other again for the rest of your lives, and you lived an ordinary waking life for another fifty years, even so on your deathbed you would still know she was part of you.”

“Trust in someone means that we no longer have to protect ourselves. We believe we will not be hurt or harmed by the other, at least not deliberately. We trust his or her good intentions, though we know we might be hurt by the way circumstances play out between us. We might say that hurt happens; it’s a given of life. Harm is inflicted; it’s a choice some people make.”

“She knew how breakups went from hearing other girls complain about them. First the pulling away, the gradual refusal to return notes or phone calls. The vague messages saying nothing was wrong, that the other person just needed a little space. Then the speech about how "It's not you, it's me." Then the crying part.
She'd never thought any of that would apply to her and Jace. What they had wasn't ordinary, or subject to the ordinary rules of relationships and breakups. They belonged to each other totally, and always will, and that was that.
But maybe everyone felt that way? Until the moment they realized they were just like everyone else, and everyone they'd thought was real shattered apart.”




“One of the most difficult things he'd ever done was turn away and leave her standing in the shadows.”



“
I KNEW IT WAS OVER
when tonight you couldn't make the phone ring
when you used to make the sun rise
when trees used to throw themselves
in front of you
to be paper for love letters
that was how i knew i had to do it
swaddle the kids we never had
against january's cold slice
bundle them in winter
clothes they never needed
so i could drop them off at my mom's
even though she lives on the other side of the country
and at this late west coast hour is
assuredly east coast sleeping
peacefully
her house was lit like a candle
the way homes should be
warm and golden
and home
and the kids ran in
and jumped at the bichon frise
named lucky
that she never had
they hugged the dog
it wriggled
and the kids were happy
yours and mine
the ones we never had
and my mom was
grand maternal, which is to say, with style
that only comes when you've seen
enough to know grace
like when to pretend it's christmas or
a birthday so
she lit her voice with tiny
lights and pretended
she didn't see me crying
as i drove away
to the hotel connected to the bar
where i ordered the cheapest whisky they had
just because it shares your first name
because they don't make a whisky
called
baby
and i only thought what i got
was what
i ordered
i toasted the hangover
inevitable as sun
that used to rise
in your name
i toasted the carnivals
we never went to
and the things you never won
for me
the ferris wheels we never
kissed on and all the dreams
between us
that sat there
like balloons on a carney's board
waiting to explode with passion
but slowly deflated
hung slave
under the pin-
prick of a tack
hung
heads down
like lovers
when it doesn't
work, like me
at last call
after too many cheap
too many sweet
too much
whisky makes me
sick, like the smell of cheap,
like the smell of
the dead
like the cheap, dead flowers
you never sent
that i never threw
out of the window
of a car
i never
really
owned”



“I'm terrified of getting involved with someone who disappoints me or leaves me empty and alone. I'm terrified of rejection, so I set my expectations so high that they can never be met, and I dig around with a magnifying glass looking for flaws in very person I date. There's always a flaw to exploit, and I'll find it so I never have to get too close.”



“People can attach themselves to something--an idea, another person, a desire--with an impossibly strong grip, and in the case of restless ghosts, a grip stronger than death. Will is a powerful thing. Will--it's supposed to be a good treat, a more determined and persistent version of determination and persistence. But will and obsession--they sit right next to each other. They pretend to be strangers and all the while meet secretly at midnight." -”



“Be careful whom you choose to love. This decision will impact your future life and happiness in ways you cannot yet imagine.”

“It is the same way with dating. The time you are most prepared for dating is when you don't need anyone to complete you, fulfill you, or instill in you a sense of worth or purpose.”



“Who does ever get what they want? It doesn’t seem to happen to many of us if any at all. It’s always two people bumping against each other blindly, acting out old ideas and dreams and mistaken understandings.”



“Everyone has their first date and the object is to hide your flaws. And then you're in a relationship, and it's all about hiding your disappointment. And then, once you're married, it's about hiding your sins.”

“Just start off with the same goals in mind. If you have the same values, same goals then you'll be on track for the same future.”

“Life had sure been simpler when I hadn't dated.”



“Sometimes you met someone that changed the pattern, who wormed their way past the cracks in your heart, caulked them up, sealed themselves in, and stayed there. Sometimes they did it by insisting you meet them at every step, as Jamie had done to me.”



“Why, you are a man of heart!"
"Sometimes," replied Phileas Fogg, quietly. "When I have the time.”



“Ordinarily, I am the person who falls in love quickly and somewhat inappropriately and then goes on to destroy what is a good thing. That's always been my style. So, you know: I get it. And I feel right now the way I imagine all those guys felt with me. And I have to say, for the first time in my life, I feel something approaching compassion for them.”



“No, I am never setting foot in this house again it scares me and makes me sad and I wish you could be a mom whose eyes worked but I don't think you can. ”



“To touch a person...to sleep with a person...is to become a pioneer," she whispered then, "a frontiersman at the edge of their private world, the strange, incomprehensible world of their interior, filled with customs you could never imitate, a language which sounds like your own but is really totally foreign, knowable only to them.”



“I still think I love him more. It's one of those things you never know for certain because there's no way to enter all the relationship data in a computer and have it spit out a definitive answer. You can't quantify love, and if you try, you wind up focusing on misleading factors.”



“How do you know? How best to ensure his nervous breakdown?" I ask.
"Keep going," Christian says. "Just go on as if nothing has happened. We all hate that.”



“For the first time in his life he understood why the Bible called sex "knowing". Everything was different. Now he
knew
Dante. He'd known Dante. And wonder of wonders, Dante had known him right back.”



“The manlier you are, the harder it is to understand what a woman wants: there is not a hint of female brain in you.”



“It's like the old question, "Do you lock your house to keep people out, or to protect what's inside?" Should a person act modestly and dress modestly in order to prevent intrusion from the outside, undesirable things from happening, or to preserve and maintain what is inside: the delicate and sensitive ability to have and maintain an intimate relationship.”



“I would be consumed by you,' she said, and blinked her eyes furiously when she felt them fill with tears. 'You would sap all the energy and all the joy from me. You would put out all the fire of my vitality.'
'Give me a chance to fan the flames of that fire,' he said, 'and to nurture your joy.”



“Our happiness is completely and utterly intertwined with other people: family and friends and neighbors and the woman you hardly notice who cleans your office. Happiness is not a noun or verb. It's a conjunction. Connective tissue.”



“To me, the thing about friendship that makes it so singular is that it’s a relationship that’s central to our identity in that it doesn’t necessarily benefit us in any tangible way. It’s a relationship we don’t have to pursue – if we decide to stop being friends one day, nothing will happen, no one’s there to legislate or adjudicate it. It’s two people who every day choose to keep it going, and in that way it’s very powerful because it’s one you choose to work on, and you choose to without any agreement; it’s an unspoken bond.”

“And you can't have two stars in one relationship. Somebody has to be willing to be the wagon...at lease some of the time”



“I feel incendiary, a wildfire. My spirit licks at the gates of a very elaborate, customized, and distracting emotional Hades.”



“For better or for worse, music is the language of memory. It is also the language of love.”



“That they were left with only this--this awkward, prearranged meet-up, this terrible silence--seemed almost more than she could bear, and the unfairness of it all welled up inside of her. It was his fault, all of it, and yet her hatred for him was the worst kind of love, a tortured longing, a misguided wish that made her heart hammer in her chest. She couldn't ignore the disjointed sensation that they were now two different pieces of two different puzzles, and nothing in the world could make them fit together again.”



“Eleanor stayed with Franklin after his repeated infidelities, and yet toward the end of her life, she regretted it, and advised her children to choose differently. ‘Never for a minute would I advocate that people who no longer love each other should live together because it does not bring the right atmosphere into a home,’ she wrote. She added that it was sad when a couple was unable to make a success of marriage, ‘but I feel it is equally unwise for people to bring up children in homes where love no longer exists.”



“Insanity is everyone expecting you not to fall apart when you find out everything you believed in was a lie.”

“The only real battle in life is between hanging on and letting go.”

“Don't be a fool. Don't give up something important to hold onto someone who can't even say they love you.”




“Once you embrace your value, talents and strengths, it neutralizes when others think less of you.”

“I suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him.”



“Then I imagined a lifetime of having to cry to get him to be kind, and I went back to no again.”



“Sometimes the door closes on a relationship, not because we failed but because something bigger than us says this no longer fits our life. So, lock the door, shed a tear, turn around and look for the new door that's opened. It's a sign that you're no longer that person you were, it's time to change into who you are. It's going to be okay.”

“It seemed that we loved each other better when there were large swaths of two continents between us. The daily work of love was often hard to perform at home. ”



“What's agitating about solitude is the inner voice telling you that you should be mated to somebody, that solitude is a mistake. The inner voice doesn't care about who you find. It just keeps pestering you, tormenting you--if you happen to be me--with homecoming queens first, then girls next door, and finally anybody who might be pleased to see you now and then at the dinner table and in bed on occasion. You look up from reading the newspaper and realize that no one loves you, and no one burns for you.”



“Why, then, did I always feel as if his happiness was my responsibility? It wasn't fair for him to burden me with that. It had never been fair.”



“Love, he realized, was like the daggers he made in his forge: When you first got one it was shiny and new and the blade glinted bright in the light. Holding it against your palm, you were full of optimism for what it would be like in the field, and you couldn't wait to try it out. Except those first couple of nights out were usually awkward as you got used to it and it got used to you.
Over time, the steel lost its brand-new gleam, and the hilt became stained, and maybe you nicked the shit out of the thing a couple of times. What you got in return, however, saved your life: Once the pair of you were well acquainted, it became such a part of you that it was an extension of your own arm. It protected you and gave you a means to protect your brothers; it provided you with the confidnece and the power to face whatever came out of the night; and wherever you went, it stayed with you, right over your heart, always there when you needed it.
You had to keep the blade up, however. And rewrap the hilt from time to time. And double-check the weight.
Funny...all of that was
well, duh
when it came to weapons. Why hadn't it dawned on him that matings were the same?
(From the thoughts of Vishous)”



“As I saw it,
all my mother's life, my father
held her down, like
lead strapped to her ankles.
She was
buoyant by nature;
she wanted to travel,
go to the theater, go to museums.
What he wanted
was to lie on the couch
with the Times
over his face,
so that death, when it came,
wouldn't seem a significant change.”



“You lose yourself, Erica, because with the right person, who you become together is something so much greater, more than you could even realize right now.”



“Miscommunication is endless.”

“Forgiveness is created by the restitution of the abuser; of the wrongdoer. It is not something to be squeeeeeezed out of the victim in a further act of conscience-corrupting abuse.”

“And since I’m marrying into the Quartet, I have certain privileges and duties. If you’re sleeping with Laurel—”
“I’m not sleeping with Laurel. We’re dating.”
“Right, and the two of you are just going to hold hands, admire the moon, and sing camp songs.”
“For a while. Minus the singing.”



“What's the difference?" You ask me
The difference is, a smile touches my lips
When I remember both the memory of you entering my life
And the memory of you leaving my life”



“Tina leans forward and asks quietly, 'Do you? You know? Love her?'
Squeezing Nat’s knee again, I reply, 'She’s teachin’ me how.”



“Maybe that's what love is. Having someone who guides you through different experiences, coaxes you to try news things but still makes you feel safe.”



“Never play cards with a man called Doc. Never eat at a place called Mom's. Never sleep with a woman whose troubles are worse than your own.”



“I didn't dream about you last night. I woke up in fear.”



“Sometimes, if she simply remained quiet, and let the inadequacy of his excuses reverberate on the air, he became ashamed and backtracked.”



“There is something beautiful about watching two people lovingly act silly together; behaving as though no one else existed.”



“God is great and God is good," Lisa says. "But where are the Apache attack helicopters when you need them?”



“The Trump marriage veered furthest away from my concept of the union — and surprised me most as a student of American politics. Donald and Melania seem to inhabit separate realms and to come together when necessary, when one could not move forward without the other. The presidency was one instance in which they were forced into a joint undertaking. If my choice of language sounds businesslike, that’s because that’s how I’ve come to view the Trumps. Having learned more about each partner’s history, I believe they are two highly ambitious individuals who benefit from their partnership. It’s a transaction: he gains a beautiful woman on his arm, a solid-seeming marriage, a son, and a savvy adviser. She gains wealth and international cachet.”



“Anya looked upon Nin admirably. Having him as a partner-in-crime—if only on this one occasion, which she hoped would only be the start of something more—was more revitalizing than the cheap thrills of a cookie-cutter shallow, superficial romance, where the top priority was how beautiful a person was on the outside.”



“~Do you like him much?
~I told you I like him a little. Where is the use of caring for him so very much? He is full of faults.
~Is he?
~All boys are.
~More than girls?
~Very likely. Wise people say it is folly to think anyboy perfect, and as to likes and diskiles, we should be friendly to all, and worship none.”



“The Heart of Gold fled on silently through the night of space, now on conventional photon drive. Its crew of four were ill as ease knowing that they had been brought together not of their own volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious perversion of physics- as if relationships between people were susceptible to the same laws that governed the relationships between atoms and molecules”



“It is not selfishness or unselfishness that distinguishes love from non-love; it is the aim of the action.”



“There isn’t any kind of relationship that’s all problem-free delightful unicorns. You can’t have a relationship without issues and prejudices. The way to be equals is if both people agree to be equals, and treat themselves and each other as equals, despite all that.”



“Unless I understand the Cross, I cannot understand why my commitment to what is right must be precedence over what I prefer.”




“When we replace a sense of service and gratitude with a sense of entitlement and expectation, we quickly see the demise of our relationships, society, and economy.”



“I was flipping channels, watching this cheerleading program on MTV. They took a field hockey girl and “transformed” her into a cheerleader by the end of the show. I was just wondering: what if she liked field hockey better?”



“Often people that settle in life are those that only do what they can with what they have and where they are. Never settle for someone that didn't know your worth from the beginning, or build a life without God in it. Live beyond your low expectations.”

“You want the fairy tale."
"I want a chance at it.”



“Marriage: a hopeful, generous, infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don’t know yet who they are or who the other might be, binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully omitted to investigate.”



“Even if toxic people are right about what is "good," they are wrong if the approach is not healthy.”



“I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that because honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had!”

“In the realm of love and sex, it’s girls who are in the position of working hard to adapt themselves to the needs and fantasies of the mercurial males whose approval and attention they seek.”



“I loved you because there was no other place for me to go. We were married because we did not know what else to do with each other. You never knew me, nothing about me, what died inside me, what lived invisibly.”



“If somebody never gets enough of you, they will always want more”

“I wanted to have a good relationship. One that's romantic and dramatic, like in the movies. But I finally became a woman at 17 and learned that men aren't really that simple.”



“Isn't everyone a part of everyone else?”

“Better not to invent her in her absence. Better to wait until she's actually here. Then he can make her up as she goes along.”



“Take me now, God!" I shout to the inky sky. "I´m ready."
"You´re not ready. You´re not even divorced yet," Bunny says. "You cannot die married to that man.”



“Only love that continues to flow in the face of anger, blame, and indifference can be called love. All else is simply a transaction.”



“I wish I hadn't. I wish I'd fought for you. I was weak and stupid.”



“Failed relationships can be described as so much wasted makeup.
Forget the laughs, forget the fights, forget the sex, forget the jealousy. But take off your hat and observe a moment's silence for the legions of unknown tubes of foundation, mascara, eyeliner, blusher and lipstick who died that it might all have been possible. But who died in vain.”



“God is even in a single parent household.”



“I had a dream about you last night. We stopped telling each other about our dreams when we realized we were still inside them.”



“If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
By self-example mayst thou be denied.”



“Our lives were now worlds apart, separated by time, circumstance, and the unbridgeable chasm of money.”



“Disagreement is not necessarily a reason to head for Splitsville. In fact, a relationship without disagreement is probably too brittle to last. Some of the best human bonds are forged in the fire of disagreement.”



“Relationships are steppingstones for the evolution of our consciousness. Each interaction we have, be it one of joy or contrast, allows us to learn more about who we are and what we want in this lifetime. They bring us into greater alignment…as long as we continue to move forward and do not get attached to hurt, anger, or being a victim.”



“Lovers are not snails; they don't have to protrude from their shells and meet each other halfway. Meet me within your own self.”



“Everything else has vanished, so you take them now. Maybe if you're the one keeping them, I'll be the one feeling better.”



“When you don’t have honesty in love then there is no communication. Honesty is improvisation of the heart; anything less is a well thought out and rehearsed script.”

“Happy wife, happy life.”



“You can't fight hatred with hatred and expect anyone to listen to you. You can only try to lessen it with humor, wit, truth and commonsense. If that doesn't work run like hell, while they throw rocks at you.”

“You cannot connect with anyone except through reality.”

“What was it about relationships that made you feel so vulnerable? Oh, right. A relationship. In any relationship, you put yourself out there. You exposed all of your sensitive nerve endings and your heart and you just had to hope that you trusted the right person.”




“It is with the soul that we grasp the essence of another human being, not with the mind, nor even with the heart.”

“Give a girl a boyfriend and she becomes a total expert on relationships”



“I was aware that we were both silently making those inevitable comparisons, putting our relationship in context. She is more this and less that. He is better or worse in these ways. It is human nature to do this--unless its your first relationship, which might be the very reason that your first relationship feels special and remains forever sacred. But the older you get, the more cynical you become, and the more complicated and convoluted the exercise is. You begin to realize that nothing is perfect, that there are trade-offs and sacrifices. The worst is when someone in your past trumps the person in the present, and you think to yourself: if I'd known this, then maybe I wouldn't have let him go.”



“She needed the chaos within her in order to discover the extraordinary no man could ever reach.”

“Two people with mental issues in a relationship does not work. It's like sitting in a boat and neither one has an oar to row the other to shore. You can meet your mirror image in life, but that doesn't mean you should marry him.”

“And when all your faith is gone let it be me, if it's a friend you need let it be me”

“A break up is the closest thing to bereavement”



“Before her marriage she had thought that she had love within her grasp; but since the happiness which she had expected this love to bring her hadn’t come, she supposed she must have been mistaken. And Emma tried to imagine just what was meant, in life, by the words “bliss,” “passion,” and “rapture” - words that had seemed so beautiful to her in books.”



“There was a tacit understanding between them that 'liquor helped'; growing more miserable with every glass one hoped for the moment of relief.”



“We were friends and have become estranged. But this was right, and we do not want to conceal and obscure it from ourselves as if we had reason to feel ashamed. We are two ships each of which has its goal and course; our paths may cross and we may celebrate a feast together, as we did - and then the good ships rested so quietly in one harbor and one sunshine that it may have looked as if they had reached their goal and as if they had one goal. But then the mighty force of our tasks drove us apart again into different seas and sunny zones, and perhaps we shall never see each other again; perhaps we shall meet again but fail to recognize each other: our exposure to different seas and suns has changed us.”



“You never know who's waiting for you and you never know when love is coming your way or who it might be. But let me just say, a healthy relationship requires SACRIFICE and DEDICATION.”



“There is nothing right or wrong in love. Where there is love, then there is nothing but only love.”



“It was a bitter moment for us. We weren't two mature parents. We were just two kids playing grown-up. We still needed Mommy and Daddy's permission, blessings, and money to survive.”

“Ain't No Drama Like Bedroom Drama”

“why provide relationship benefits to someone who claims they don't want a relationship...”

“Jump, if you want to, ‘cause I’ll catch you, girl. I’ll catch you “fore you fall. Go as far inside as you need to, I’ll hold your ankles. Make sure you get back out. I’m not saying this because I need a place to stay. That’s the last thing I need. I told you, I’m a walking man, but I been heading in this direction for seven years. Walking all around this place. Upstate, downstate, east, west; I been in territory ain’t got no name, never staying nowhere long. But when I got here and sat out there on the porch, waiting for you, well, I knew it wasn’t the place I was heading toward; it was you. We can make a life, girl. A life.”



“I had a dream about you last night... you were there.”



“I don't want you to be young and beautiful. I only want one thing. I want you to be kind-hearted - and not just towards cats and dogs.”



“If I have to 'catch' a man to get a husband, I don't want one.”



“In love, treat your relationship as if you are growing the most beautiful flower. Keep watering it, tend to its roots, give it lots of sunlight, and always make sure the petals are full of color and are never curling. Once you neglect your plant, it will die, as will your relationship.”



“All relationships have ups and downs. Romantic fantasy often nurtures the belief that difficulties and down times are an indication of a lack of love rather than part of the process. In actuality, true love thrives of the difficulties. The foundation of such love is the assumption that we want to grow and expand, to become more fully ourselves. There is no change that does not bring with it a feeling of challenge and loss. When we experience true love it may feel as though our lives are in danger; we may feel threatened.”



“Your judgments about another person say more about your own character than the character of the person you are pointing a finger at.
This is the key and one of the most fundamental insights about the ‘red flags’ that we often dismiss regarding the people in our lives. If someone complains a lot to you about other people, guess what? That is part of their current character. And, as quickly as the tide changes, you can just as easily become the person they target and criticize, point fingers at, and negatively judge. Forever and always, until vibrations are raised, this will be the cycle of the relationship. So, it’s your choice to continue to engage in the cycle with them, or to move on.
There are plenty of people who do not criticize, point fingers, or judge. THIS is the kind of character we want to foster within ourselves. THIS is the character of the kind of people we DO want to develop close relationships with.”



“In marriage, each partner is to be an encourager rather than a critic; a forgiver rather than a collector of hurts; an enabler rather than a reformer.”

“Theres nothing more efficient than honesty and nothing more powerful than vulnerability because, vulnerability reveals everyone in your life who will abuse power immediately and almost irrevocably.
Theres nothing weaker than hiding your vulnerability because, it means a refusal to stare at those who abuse power and see them for who they are which means they still have power and control over you. Nothing is stronger than vulnerability. Nothing more clarifying. Nothing is clearer than vulnerability, and if you hide who you are you are just making a tombstone of your everyday actions because you dont exist in hiding and you're letting the past rob you.
Exercise the power of vulnerability. When you are vulnerable you are signaling to your system that the past is over and done! That you're no longer a victim! That you're no longer trapped in a destructive and abusive environment! vulnerability means it's over, it's done. The war is over but, if you continue to use the same defenses that you had in the past all you're telling your whole body is that the past is not over.
Be vulnerable. Be honest. Be open and show your heart. That's the best way of telling your heart that the tigers are no longer in the grass. I'm telling you, just take it for a spin. Vulnerability and openness will get you what you want in your life and hiding will only get you the feeling of being prey from here until the end of your life.”

“Too many doubts grow in the cracks of silence and separation.”



“The people at the center of these stories of power couples mostly choose to see their own motives as selfless. In Elizabeth Edwards’ autobiography Resilience, she wrote of her marriage to John, U.S. senator from North Carolina, ‘We were lovers, life companions, crusaders, side by side, for a vision of what the country could be.’ When she found out he was cheating on her, the crusading together became ‘the glue’ that kept them together. ‘I grabbed hold of it. I needed to,’ Edwards wrote. ‘Although I no longer knew what I could trust between the two of us, I knew I could trust in our work together.’ She wanted ‘an intact family fighting for causes more important than any one of us.”



“Don't show a friend your gift, or your bag of money if you still want to maintain your relationship, but if nay, go on, and all you'll see is hate and jealousy, and you'll fight with him in the street like a dog and all you'll feel is regret.”

“Elizabeth Bennet, will you do me the great honor of not going to prom with me?”



“I had a dream about you last night. We were plug sockets in the bedroom. We saw only a short part of their day, but we knew everything of it.”



“There is a relationship between the eye contacts we make and the perceptions that we create in our heads, a relationship between the sound of another's voice and the emotions that we feel in our hearts, a relationship between our movements in space all around us and the magnetic pulls we can create between others and ourselves. All of these things (and more) make up the magic of every ordinary day and if we are able to live in this magic, to feel and to dwell in it, we will find ourselves living with magic every day. These are the white spaces in life, the spaces in between the written lines, the cracks in which the sunlight filters into. Some of us swim in the overflowing of the wine glass of life, we stand and blink our eyes in the sunlight reaching unseen places, we know where to find the white spaces, we live in magic.”

“I don't even know her yet..but if she could see me right now, I'd want her to know that I love her”




“It is the mind which creates the world around us, and even though we stand side by side in the same meadow, my eyes will never see what is beheld by yours, my heart will never stir to the emotions with which yours is touched.”

“When a girl uses six derogatory adjectives in her attempt to paint the portrait of the loved one, it means something. One may indicate a merely temporary tiff. Six is big stuff.”



“Its dark and I’m reading my scars because our moments remind me of where I should be.”

“You're only responsible for being honest, not for someone else's reaction to your honesty.”



“Undeniable chemistry and horrific timing. They love each other.”

“Women, in general, will find it difficult to turn from a man and stop demanding that he meets their needs, provides security, and protects their identity, and return to me. Men, in general, find it very hard to turn from the works of their hands, their own quests for power and security and significance, and turn to me.”



“One has only to set a loved human being against the fact that we are all in peril all the time to get back a sense of proportion. What does anything matter compared to the reality of love and its span, so brief at best, maintained against such odds?”



“Love is beyond reason. Love is not measurable in words. Love cannot be partial; it cannot have owners. Love is essentially beyond definition or concept.”

“Eleanor was an orphan at the age of 10. She went to live with her maternal Grandma Hall, a bitter and biblically strict woman who nonetheless struggled to control her children. Eleanor had to endure some uncles who drank to excess and possibly abused her. For protection, her grandmother or an aunt installed three heavy locks on Eleanor’s bedroom door. A girlfriend who slept over asked Eleanor about the locks. She said they were “to keep my uncles out.”



“When certain parts of our bodies are touched, certain enzymes and chemicals that trigger sexual desire are released into our system. The more our bodies are stimulated, the more chemicals are released and the greater our sexual desire grows until it becomes a virtually unstoppable flood.”



“Better guilt than the terrible burden of freedom and responsibility.”



“In relationships, there are no beginning and no end.”

“Mismatches destroy us all, even the most tender ones, and most never have the courage to break someone else's heart to follow their own.”



“You aren't alive if you aren't in need.”



“Sacrifices made for love are fine, unless the sacrifice is you.”

“Some of us were brought into this troubled world primarily or only to increase our fathers’ chances of not being left by our mothers, or vice versa.”



“Connecting with someone is not necessarily a bond with a significant other, or even a friend, but can be the indefinable - perhaps the rarest and most precious thing in life to find at all.”

“For someone who is supposed to be a knight in shining armor, you're acting like an ass in aluminum foil.”



“Traveling in a third-world country is the closest thing there is to being married and raising kids. You have glorious hikes and perfect days on the beach. You go on adventures you would never try, or enjoy, alone. But you also can't get away from each other. Everything is unfamiliar. Money is tight or you get robbed. Someone gets sick or sunburned. You get bored. It is harder than you expected, but you are glad you didn't just sit home.”



“When people grow up in a home where extramarital sex is condoned, they’re much less likely to regard it as a deal-breaker. Jacqueline Bouvier’s father, ‘Black Jack,’ confided in her about his female conquests, even going so far as to play a game with Jackie when he visited her at boarding school. She would point to a classmate’s mother, and Jack would respond, ‘Yes’ or ‘Not yet’ — answering the silent question, had he slept with that one?”



“I think that you can love more than one person in a lifetime. There's the one who teaches you what love is, even if it doesn't last. … And then there's the one who makes you a better human than you were, even as you do the same form him. … And then there's the last one ... The one that you never get enough time with. But who sees you through to the end.”



“The best relationships are between two people who care more about each other's good than their own momentary pleasure.”



“To love purely is to consent to distance, it is to adore the distance between ourselves and that which we love.”



“Things certainly aren't the way you imagine them when you're a kid and dreaming big dreams about what your life as a grown-up will look like.”



“I didn’t answer. We were not buddies. We could not chat about the proximity of our offices, or football, or forgiveness.”



“Just because lips have met doesn't mean hearts have joined. And just because two bodies are drawn to each other doesn't mean two people are right for each other. A physical relationship does not equal love.”



“I had a dream about you last night.. you were trying to give coordinates to an apple”



“Young love is so ridiculous, as is middle-aged and old love. And it’s also hilarious. When have you ever felt so vulnerable and wonderful and terrible at the same time?”

“A wedding is and event, but marriage is a life.”




“When a man has seen the woman whom he would have chosen if he had intended to marry speedily, his remaining a bachelor will usually depend on her resolution rather than on his.”



“Look for the heart in a man before you look at what he has.”



“But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people--first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy.”



“It's not other people that hurt us, but what we feel about them”



“He looked at her and tried to discover behind her lascivious expression the familiar features that he loved tenderly. It was as if he were looking at two images through the same lens, at two images superimposed one on the other with one showing through the other. These two images showing through each other were telling him that
everything
was in the girl, that her soul was terrifyingly amorphous, that it held faithfulness and unfaithfulness, treachery and innocence, flirtatiousness and chastity. This disorderly jumble seemed disgusting to him, like the variety to be found in a pile of garbage. Both images continued to show through each other, and the young man understood that the girl differed only on the surface from other women, but deep down was the same as they: full of all possible thoughts, feelings, and vices, which justified all his secret misgivings and fits of jealousy. The impression that certain outlines delineated her as an individual was only a delusion to which the other person, the one who was looking, was subject--namely himself. It seemed to him that the girl he loved was a creation of his desire, his thoughts, and his faith and that the
real
girl now standing in front of him was hopelessly other, hopelessly alien, hopelessly
ambiguous
. He hated her.”



“It's always seemed to me that flirtation is a man's device for avoiding responsibility. He can say whatever he wants and knows he won't be taken seriously.”



“[novan]: bassists are very good with their fingers
[novan]: and some of us sing backup vocals, so that means we're good with our mouths too...

“It is in our relations with other people that we gain a sense of ourselves; it's that, pretty much, that makes relations with other people unbearable.”



“When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth.”

“There's something I have to say," I said seriously, looking her in the eye.
She smiled. "Oookay." She was mocking me-mocking my tone-but I didn't care.
"Okay. Here it is. I love you," I said. "And I never, ever wanted to hurt you. It's like, the number one thing I never want to do, but somehow, I keep doing it. And I'm sorry, I just...that's all I wanted to say all this time. All I was trying to do...with that thing with your dad, not telling you...was not to hurt you. And I'm sorry that I did.
Alley stared at me.
"And I'm sorry that I did it again. With the Chloe thing. Which was stupid. Like, really, really, stupid. And I-"
"Can you just stop, for a second?" Ally said, holding up a hand.
"What?" I said.
"Can you say the first part again?" she asked, rolling her fingers around for a rewind.
I racked my brain.
"Um...I love you?" I said.
"That's the part, Cuz I love you, too.”



“Faithfulness in small things leads to faithfulness in great things, and never the other way around.”



“Being faithful and monogamous is not natural for human beings. It takes work. Deep down we all know that. We have all been tempted to stray at some point or another. Even when it was only a fleeting thought and we didn't act on it. Every time we acknowledge that someone of the opposite sex is "attractive" or "sexy" we are doing nothing other than pointing out that they would be a suitable mate. Not acting on that natural impulse to want to mate with a viable mating partner requires a conscious decision. It's a constant struggle between what your body wants, and what the civilized part of your brain says you should do, in order to avoid the negative consequences of cheating on your spouse and ruining your long-term relationship. That's why affairs, and extra-marital sex, are often referred to as "a moment of weakness.”



“Women were excited after sex, wired becasue in their minds the relationship was on beginning. Men went to sleep m the because for the orgasm had arrived and the relationship was done.”



“He was one of those quite rare adults who communicate with small children fairly well and who love them all impartially--not in a sugary way but in a businesslike fashion that may sometimes entail a hug, in the same way that closing a big business deal may call for a handshake.”



“I spend the rest of the afternoon trying to explain to Zoe one of the very saddest notions in love and life: sometimes the timing is wrong--and sometimes you realize the heart of the matter way to late in the game.”



“There is no formula to relationships. They have to be negotiated in loving ways, with room for both parties, what they want and what they need, what they can do and what their life is like.”



“By the end of the four-year term, Americans hold a bifurcated view of Mrs. Trump. Many Republicans, especially women, revere her as elegant, graceful, beautiful and wronged by the press. A pastor in Missouri held up Melania as a wifely model to which other women should aspire — or risk losing their men. At the same time some southern preachers referred to then-Senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris as Jezebel, the Bible’s most nefarious woman and archetype of female cunning. There could be no surer sign that the life stories of prominent women affect the lives of private women than when pastors hold them up as positive or negative role models.”



“Emotions don’t interfere in my acting, nor in my life.”



“It is so simple, yet so hard for some people to do. If you want someone out of your life then you and only “you” must tell him or her to leave. This can only be done by you. Otherwise, your silence shouts, “I am undecided.” When other people get involved it sends mixed signals. If only more people would be so bold, hearts would not linger so long.”

“You kissed me once and now you feel as if you’ve got some special kind of licence to do it whenever you want?”



“I think she cared more for that bloody dog than for me, for us. And maybe that's not so stupid, looking back... maybe it is easier living on your own looking after some stupid mutt than sharing your life with other actual human beings.”



“I have to wonder if you're not being slightly naive here. I mean, are you saying that you want nothing for people? You have no motives? Everybody has motives. Name the person, the circumstances, I'll name the motive. Even saints have motives -- to feel like saints, probably. ... But still, the point of any relationship is obtaining something from another person.”



“What a thing to acknowledge in your heart! To lose a brother is to lose someone with whom you can share the experience of growing old, who is supposed to bring you a sister-in-law and nieces and nephews, creatures to people the tree of your life and give it new branches. To lose your father is to lose the one whose guidance and help you seek, who supports you like a tree trunk supports its branches. To lose your mother, well, that is like losing the sun above you. It is like losing-I’m sorry, I would rather not go on.”



“The clerk is looking at me. His expression hasn't changed. What I want to do is punch a hole in the front of the desk, reach through, grab his balls, and make him sing The Mickey Mouse Club song. But these days, I'm working on the theory that killing everyone I don't like might be counterproductive. I'm learning to use my indoor voice like a big boy, so I smile back at the clerk.”



“He told me that from now on, everything I did and everything he did was of the utmost importance: any word spoken, the slightest gesture, would take on a meaning, and everything that happened between us would change us continually. 'For that reason,'he said,'I wish I were able to suspend time at this moment and keep things exactly at this point, because I feel this instant is a true beginning. We have a definite but unknown quantity of experience at our disposal. As soon as the hourglass is turned, the sand will begin to run out and once it starts, it cannot stop until it's all gone. That's why I wish I could hold it back at the start. We should make a minimum of gestures, pronounce a minimum of words, even see each other as seldom as possible, if that would prolong things. We don't know how much of everything we have ahead of us so we have to take the greatest precautions not to destroy the beauty of what we have. Everything exists in limited quantity-especially happiness. If a love is to come into being, it is all written down somewhere, and also its duration and content. If you could arrive at the complete intensity the first day, it would be ended the first day. And so if it's something you want so much that you'd like to have it prolonged in time, you must be extremely careful not to make the slightest excessive demand that might prevent it from developing to the greatest extent over the longest period...If the wings of the butterfly are to keep their sheen, you mustn't touch them. We mustn't abuse something which is to bring light into both our lives. Everything else in my life only weighs me down and shuts out the light. This thing wih you seems like a window that is opening up. I want it to remain open...”



“Love life comes last in my life. I put real life first.”

“I realize the thing about a guy you've spent your whole life loving from afar is that even though he's real you've really made most of him up.”



“I had a dream about you last night.. You thought you were a candy vampire, you were standing in the sun screaming 'I'm melting.”



“I had a dream about you last night... I was a brick and you were a blanket. Damn that improbability drive.”



“Love doesn't make the world go 'round; love is what makes the ride worthwhile.”

“I know how you feel because I’ve been there too. I’ve hated and I’ve loved. I’ve seen my demons root and crawl and my angels branch and soar. I've died within myself and lived a thousand different lives. I too fight the same war and I too am drowning in the puddles of self-consciousness this world created.”

“Each piece of glass is another piece of myself I gave to him.
It's too bad I didn't keep any pieces for myself.”




“People are meant to go through life two by two. ’Tain’t natural to be lonesome.”



“As for myself: I had come to the conclusion that there was nothing sacred about myself or any human being, that we were all machines, doomed to collide and collide and collide. For want of anything better to do, we became fans of collisions. Sometimes I wrote well about collisions, which meant I was a writing machine in good repair. Sometimes I wrote badly, which meant I was a writing machine in bad repair. I no more harbored sacredness than did a Pontiac, a mousetrap, or a South Bend Lathe.”



“A pure heart is superlatively rare and even more attractive.”



“A woman may be beautiful but have poor character. A man may be a business genius, making money left and right, but lack common courtesy, sensitivity, and compassion.”



“...there remained a strange formality between them, and her pleasure in his presence felt too much like missing him had felt during the last week.”



“A Plan B life can be just as good or better than a Plan A life. You just have to let go of that first dream and realize that God has already written the first chapter of the new life that awaits you. All you have to do is start reading!”

“I always watch you. You consume my every thought.”



“At the end of the day I went to this place where your memories left footsteps on my skin and the breath of your touch stained my desire. Yea, it was one of those nights where I needed you the most.”

“There are only two ways to live your life. One as if all that matters is to have someone love and accept you. The other is as though loving and accepting another person is all that matters. Often, when you choose the second you get the first.”

“You wouldn't believe that so much could change just because a relationship ended.”



“I don't talk with everybody because i am not everybody, i am single.”

“Trust is not a gasoline-soaked blanket that succumbs to the matches of betrayal, never able to be used for its warmth again; it’s a tapestry that wears thin in places, but can be patched over if you have the right materials, circumstances, and patience to repair it. If you don’t, you’re always the one who feels the coldest when winter comes.”



“No, I don't think I could fall in love with him, handsome though he is, because I don't accept any of that huff he gives me about my great beauty and all that. I'd have to trust a man's words before I could love him. I think.”



“I love you, he thought, because you are honest with me and because you are willing to speak the truth to me when others might seek to curry favor instead. I love you because you are in this bed with me, not trying to conceive the much-awaited next generation of Windhams, but just holding my hand.
-- Gayle Windham”



“We cannot win in team situations or in relationships by ourselves. It is like trying to pick up a pencil with only one finger...Even if that one finger is extremely strong, it will prove almost impossible to pick up that pencil unless you use your other fingers or some other part of your hand. Teamwork is a bit like using all of your fingers. Each one is unique and contributes something different, but they unite in pursuit of a common goal.”

“Among the many answers I have found, I believe love is the most beautiful and simple art that reflects the beauty of life.”

“Dumped doesn't even begin to describe it. If you're going to use a trash metaphor, incinerated is more like it.”



“Love tames the benumbed beast. A man is put to use regarding a woman's physical safety, but a woman is put to use regarding a man's mental safety.”



“The seeking of a mate shall be undertaken with due preparation and care. A life-bond should never be contemplated as a light thing--unlike a legal union or sanctified joining, the sealing of souls CANNOT be severed. When a mate is SOULBOUND to another--LIFEMATED, as some have come to regard it--a mystery is engaged. In one aspect mystical, the lifemating process is the most sublime endeavor that a Refarian may assume. Once formed, the bond must be ever cherished and nurtured by the process of lifelong rigor.”



“I was going to say the beginning is the good part, when it's all sparks and sparkles, before they are inevitably unmasked as assholes.”



“Relationships unlock certain parts of who we are supposed to be.”

“I had a dream about you last night... You turned red, then green, and then blue. You told me you were trying to fit in with the m&m's.”



“The inner woman is the source of healing. The inner woman is the source of silence. The inner woman is the source of love. The inner woman is the source of belongingness with life. Embracing the inner man and woman is to discover our inner roots and wings.”



“Lord, I pray that my husband will be strong in the Lord and put on the whole armor of God, so he can stand against the enemy every day. Enable him to take up the shield of faith, helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.”



“You are the flame, not the moth. And your job is to burn with conviction.”



“I had a dream about you last night.. You were in the amazon rain forest yipping like a dog.”



“I had a dream about you last night... You tried to propose with a digital ceramic heater.”



“Love is supposed to be based on trust, and trust on love, it's something rare and beautiful when people can confide in each other without fearing what the other person will think.”




“It was told to me, it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects, and told me, as I thought, with triumph. This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested; and it has not been only once; I have had her hopes and exultations to listen to again and again. I have known myself to be divided from Edward forever, without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection. Nothing has proved him unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me. I have had to content against the unkindness of his sister and the insolence of his mother, and have suffered the punishment of an attachment without enjoying its advantages. And all this has been going on at the time when, as you too well know, it has not been my only unhappiness. If you can think me capable of ever feeling, surely you may suppose that I have suffered
now
.”



“Every advantage is temporary.”

“At your absolute best, you still won't be good enough for the wrong person. At your worst, you'll still be worth it to the right person.”

“Don't feed your ego with my soul.”

“With all honesty, somewhere between the hello and the dreams I saw you in I fell in love.”

“Is it not the great end of religion, and, in particular, the glory of Christianity, to extinguish the malignant passions; to curb the violence, to control the appetites, and to smooth the asperities of man; to make us compassionate and kind, and forgiving one to another; to make us good husbands, good fathers, good friends; and to render us active and useful in the discharge of the relative social and civil duties? ”

“Then we’re just sitting there, staring at each other. Which has been happening a lot lately. It’s like
whatever wall there was between us, however she was holding herself back from me . . . all of that
pretense is gone.
“And when you find a soul mate,” Sara says, “it’s undeniable. You have to be together.”
“That’s my philosophy.” I look back at her. “You have to go with the flow.”
“Exactly. I think the universe guides you to make the right choices.”
“Do you believe in fate?”
“I guess, but . . . it’s more about creating the life you want so you can make that fate a reality. You
know?”

“She wasn't broken. She was just bent, over the chance of being ignored by the one she loved.”

“It’s the people we hardly know, and not our closest friends, who will improve our lives most dramatically”



“But some relationships aren't meant to last.
They are worthy only till the time the two persons involved have time for each other.
They do not know eternity. They live for the present, the "now". And when distance plays it part, or life turns out to be busy, they fall apart.
And may be that's why they're never termed "LOVE". They simply remain what they were - mere RELATIONSHIPS.”

“Wearing a condom is like eating an icecream cone with a sock on your tongue.”

“Everyone disliked their partners at some time or another, she knew that. But she’d spent her hours in the dark wondering whether she’d ever liked him. Would it really have been so much worse to spend those years alone? Why did there have to be someone else in the room while she was eating, watching TV, sleeping?”



“Helplessness and anger make for predictable behavior: Children are certain to shove each other and pull hair, teenagers will call each other names and cry, and grown women who are sisters will say words so cruel that each syllable will take on the form of a snake, although such a snake often circles in on itself to eat its own tail once the words are said aloud.”



“There is no key to open the heart of another - except curiosity.”

“All the black leather
she needs
is the E-Z boy recliner
where her love is parked
with one of his hands wrapped around a remote,
the other, a bottle of beer.
She's right. It's kinky.
The way he doesn't look away
from the TV,
as her head bobs
in his lap
like a fisherman's float
on a nature program,
hectic
with the pace
his breath sets.
His crotch swells
under her mouth's
prowess. He's such
a sweetheart
he waits
until the
commercials
to come.”



“He smiled without his teeth. Small, shyly. I found myself smiling back. Like an impulse
Then he ruined it by saying…
"You're not like other girls, are you?"
And I activated.
Every single emotion I'd been squashing into my guts exploded like a burst appendix. I jumped off the bed and turned to him with a scowl I was sure he'd need permanent therapy to recover from.
"Are you kidding me Harry?"
"Woah Audrey. Hey, hey, hey. It's a compliment."
I felt like screaming.
"It's NOT a compliment.
I threw my arms up, any motion to get rid of the rage pulsing through me.
It's an insult to every single woman on this PLANET. Don't you DARE try and pull that shit on me.
"What shit?!" Harry was stupid enough to ask. "I was saying something nice…"
I shook my head so hard.
"No, you were saying something clichéd and UNTRUE. I AM like other girls, Harry. Don't misinterpret my hatred of romance as some kooky, laid-back, manic pixie NONSENSE. I am DAMAGED. I am not CUTE. I am emotionally-fucking-traumatised right now, okay? I am screaming on the inside. I am too angry and messed up to contain all the stuff girls spend every day containing. That's why I seem different. That is NOT sexy.”



“I had a dream about you last night. We went to the store cupboard to make out, but we ended up sharing our pain and then crying together. We wasn't prepared for this level of intimacy.”



“She seemed to think that one of the perks of marriage was that it gave you rights of comment and intrusion over single people's love lives.”



“I'm not saying that I think one man is better than the other. I'm not saying that either is kinder or wiser or more ambitious, more thoughtful, confident, or able. But the fact is that when I'm with the one, comfort settles into my bones. I feel calm around him, as if the sun is smiling down on me and the world has suddenly become a sweet, safe place to be. I feel good about life―about myself. And it's hard not to want to be near someone who, just by their very nature, makes you feel that way.”



“Don't waste time thinking about them. If they walked away from your love, they don't deserve your pain.”

“...you do not have too many boogeymen for me. You have just the right number.”

“It was no coincidence, that fear could move a person to extremes, just as seamlessly as love. They were the conjoined twins of emotion: If you didn't know what was at stake to lose, you had nothing to fight for.”



“FRIDA KAHLO TO MARTY MCCONNELL

“Becoming aware of our inner man and woman means to discover the roots and creative potential of both the male and female aspect within ourselves. Becoming aware of the inner man and woman means to understand that they have different visions of life. It means to understand that they have different perspectives and views of life. The inner man and woman are our two wings of love and freedom. Through awareness, acceptance and understanding, we can allow our two wings to develop in a deep and natural harmony. In the world today, a one-sided development of the male side leads to destructivity. A one-sided development of the male side leads to ego, struggle, exhaustion and a separation from life. A one-sided development of the female side leads to passivity and dependence.”



“People are more likely to remember the great social interaction they had with a colleague than the great meeting they both attended.”



“I had a dream about you last night... Unfortunately, it wasn't a dream.”



“I had a dream about you last night.. You kept screaming at Ted Danson to pour you a drink.”



“I had a dream about you last night... Well I say dream I mean nightmare... you were a Yankee fan.”



“I had a dream about you. You were being hung. I had a sword in one hand and a stool in the other. I couldn’t decide which one to use, so I stood on the stool and threw myself on the sword. It was the least I could do to protest capital punishment.”



“dealing with any man means dealing with multiple personalities.”




“When a man plays with your heart it is for one of two reasons: He knows he can or he is undecided.”

“If you do not respect your own wishes, no one else will. You will simply attract people who disrespect you as much as you do.”

“Faith doesn't get you around problems in life and relationships, it gets you through it.”



“How could I live above the water or breathe under it. How could I swim in darkness consumed in an ocean of you? Falling or flying towards you, losing or finding myself in you and beauty was never the word to catch all that you are. For now I know the means of the infinite and it all starts and ends with you.”

“Every time you mistreat someone, you reveal the part of you that lacks love and needs to heal.”

“You can only trust your emotions as you can lie to yourself with your brain but not your heart.”

“If I knew how a lot of my relationships would have turned out, I never would have gotten involved in them... And I would have missed out on some of the best times in my life.”



“Some people are oil and water.”



“Suddenly I remembered that laugh, it told a different story, our story.”

“Miro, I'm so sorry. I always felt such pity for you humans because you could only think of one thing at a time and your memories were so imperfect and . . . now I realize that just getting through the day without killing somebody can be an achievement."
It gets to be a habit. Most of us manage to keep our body count quite low. It's the neighborly way to live.”



“People don't get to our ages without having pasts. I'm more interested in the future.”



“There is a soul-jealousy that can be as frantic as any body-jealousy.”



“Parker: She believed, absolutely, that each person, each heart, had a counterpart—had a mate. A rightness. She’d always believed it, and understood that unshakable belief was a reason she was good at what she did.”

“I decided that giving a girl a ring when you're not in a serious relationship is sort of like giving a guy a blow job when you have no real feelings for him. It makes everything feel a little cheap.It cheapens the giver and the recipient.”



“A horrible end is better than endless horror.”



“Mine Enemy is growing old --
I have at last Revenge --
The Palate of the Hate departs --
If any would avenge

Let him be quick -- the Viand flits --
It is a faded Meat --
Anger as soon as fed is dead --
'Tis starving makes it fat”



“He had known so much about her once -what she thought, how she felt, the reasons for her actions. And now he only knew that he loved her, and all the other knowledge seemed passing from him just as he needed it most.”



“You can always evaluate a man's character by the way he speaks about his ex girlfriends and other women. When entering a new relationship or getting close with a new guy, make sure you take notice of the language he uses when referring to other girls”



“There was a time Jeff and Helen loved each other and touched each other's hands and ate breakfast in cafes together and secretly fucked in public, the way people in like do. Then came a time they made each other crazy and beat their hands on steering wheels and tore up love letters and photographs and said goodbye.”



“Proclaim your pride and bitterness loudly to the world, but to me speak softly, and tell me simply that she doesn't love you.”



“The key in letting go is practice. Each time we let go, we disentangle ourselves from our expectations and begin to experience things as they are.”



“There is such a shelter in each other.”

“Reva often spoke about 'settling down.' That sounded like death to me.
'I'd rather be alone than anybody's live-in prostitute,' I said to Reva.”



“...workplace dynamics are no less complicated or unexpectedly intense than family relations, with only the added difficulty that whereas families are at least well-recognised and sanctioned loci for hysteria reminiscent of scenes from Medea, office life typically proceeds behind a mask of shallow cheerfulness, leaving workers grievously unprepared to handle the fury and sadness continually aroused by their colleagues.”



“Remember, that choosing to stay on the ground is a choice to facilitate a relationship, to honor it. You don't play a game or color a picture with a child to show your superiority. Rather, you choose to limit yourself so as to facilitate and honor that relationship... It is not about winning and losing, but about love and respect.”



“No one human being knows the full truth about another human being. Not even one's nearest and dearest.”



“I don't want your love unless you know I am repulsive, and love me even as you know it.”

“To make him important in one’s life requires an overactive imagination. Unfortunately, mine never knows when to quit.”



“I had a dream about you. We couldn't decide on a sunrise. You wanted a tan, I only cared about the view. Then World War III fulfilled both our desires.”



“The greatest love stories are not those in which love is only spoken, but those in which it is acted upon.”




“When you can’t reach the standards of another’s heart you must ask yourself,
"What value do I put on my soul that I would subject myself to such rejection?”



“You never walk alone. Even the devil is the lord of flies.”

“When you want to share something with another person more than anything, it is one of the most difficult things to realize that you can never have it. Accepting this realization is even more difficult. Loving someone does mean saying goodbye to them in some cases, though we will fight that until the oftentimes bitter end before doing the right thing.”

“I know you think I'm crazy. Maybe that's because I am. About life, about this moment, about you.”



“First of all, never buy a man a plasma TV until you're married. A lot of men once they have a plasma TV they don't need a girlfriend”

“Then, what's the matter?' I wonder, in fact, how many times I have said that or something equal to it to a woman passing palely through my life.
What're you thinking? What's made you so quiet? You seem suddenly different. What's the matter?
Love
me
is what this means, of course. Or at least, second best: surrender. Or at the
very
least, take some time regaling me with why you won't, and maybe by the end you will.”



“That was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love that does not exist. but darling, You are the only exception”

“Lovers do things together! They rent videos, they ride Ferris wheels, they go out for pizza, they play Scrabble. They . . . they talk!'
'Talk?' He lifted his head and frowned, his eyes puzzled. 'We talk all the time, Raine. I've never had such talkative sex.'
'That's just it!' She wiggled, flailed, but couldn't budge him. 'Two minutes alone with you, and I'm flat on my back. Every single time!'
A slow, knowing grin spread over his face. 'Is this your way of telling me you want to be on top?”



“If you never left anything or anyone there would be no room for the new. Naturally, to move on is an infidelity -- to others, to the past, to old notions of oneself. Perhaps every day should contain at least one essential infidelity or necessary betrayal. It would be an optimistic, hopeful act, guaranteeing belief in the future -- a declaration that things can be not only different but better.”



“We Are Lovable
Even if the most important person in your world rejects you, you are still real, and you are still okay.”



“Bones,” I sighed. “Know something? I’m not afraid of you, but you scare
me….” His outline blurred again.
“You scare me, too, Kitten,” he might have replied, but I couldn’t be sure.”



“The protagonist, Amanda, discusses her sex relationship with her husband, John Paul --
As long as it's done with honesty and grace, John Paul doesn't mind if I go to bed with other men. Or with other girls, as is sometimes my fancy. What has marriage got to do with it? Marriage is not a synonym for monogamy any more than monogamy is a synonym for ideal love. To live lightly on the earth, lovers and families must be more flexible and relaxed. The ritual of sex releases its magic inside or outside the marital bond. I approach that ritual with as much humility as possible and perform it whenever it seems appropriate. As for John Paul and me, a strange spurt of semen is not going to wash our love away.”



“Maybe what this is. What we have, is something that will save us from ourselves.”

“The greater the gap between self perception and reality, the more aggression is unleashed on those who point out the discrepancy.”

“It happens the world over - we love ourselves more than we do the one we say we love. We all want to be Number One, we've got to be Number One or nothing! We can't see that we could make ourselves loved and needed in the Number Two, or Three, or Four spot. No sir, we've got to be Number One, and if we can't make it, we'll rip and tear at the loved one till we've ruined every smidgin of love that was ever there.”



“Just because he likes the same bizzaro crap as you doesn't mean he's your soul mate.”

“A relationship needs constant attention. It’s a living thing, not just a habit. You’ve got to keep on top of it.”



“How can I grieve what is still in motion?" I ask her. "Shoes are still dropping all over the place. I´m not kidding," I say. "It´s Normandy out there.”



“This is where men and women are different, we can put aside petty competition for relationships - they can't. It interferes.”



“To save face, it's better not to ask sex from the ex, but to give everything the axe.”

“Successful relationships are those relationships were conflicts are successfully resolved and in fact peoples intimacy, closeness, and love are enhanced through the resolution of conflicts. I have always become closer to my wife and to my friends when we have conflicts and work through them successfully because conflicts will always arise. They are an opportunity for intimacy, self-knowledge, and a greater connection.”

“She realized, when relationships failed to last, it was not because love was no longer present, but because people had stopped believing in themselves and in their partners.”



“I could now see her the way she actually is and not in the distorted way my mind presented her to me when I was trying to find a reason to reject her and move on”



“Did you know that wherever you find fool's gold, real gold exists somewhere nearby? This also goes for relationships and friendships. Real gold is found in the heart. For every piece of fake gold that you discard, remember that true gold isn't too far.”



“In every one of the Greeks' mythology tales, there is this: a man chasing a woman, or a woman chasing a man. There is never a meeting in the middle.”



“When all one person do is complain, people don't want to talk or listen to them.”

“She was very beautiful and he felt he loved her. She was not beautiful as a state or a picture is beautiful; she was beautiful as a meadow across which the wind blows. It was life that pulsed in her and that had formed her into what she was.”



“I've decided that there isn't much difference in the way we treat our siblings and the way we treat our special someones. But at the end of it all we know our siblings have to forgive us...or they'll never be able to borrow our car.”

“I had a dream about you. You suggested to split the profits, so I did. I threw one half in the furnace to power the steam engine, and the other half in the air to distract our pursuers.”



“There are so many movies like this, where you thought you were smarter than the screen but the director was smarter than you, of course he's the one, of course it was a dream, of course she's dead, of course, it's hidden right there, of course it's the truth and you in your seat have failed to notice in the dark.”




“Every configuration of people is an entirely new universe unto itself.”



“No people find each other more absurd than lovers”



“Even before we met and long after we're both gone, my heart lives inside of yours. I'm forever and ever in love with you.”



“I missed you so much," she breathed.
I tilted my head back and put my hands on her shoulders. I could hardly believe this was happening. I was finally getting to touch her. To kiss her. It was all happening. "I missed you, too.”



“This is what it is to love an artist: The moon is always rising above your house. The houses of your neighbors look dull and lacking in moonlight. But he is always going away from you. Inside his head there is always something more beautiful.”



“It took hours to turn the clock back 30 seconds.”



“Maybe, if you can't get someone out of your head they were never meant to leave. Perhaps, they were meant to help change you into the person you have been waiting to become.”

“Too often in my life, love has been defined as "humiliation with occasional roses".”



“It seemed that everyone else could mate, could fit their parts together in pleasant and productive ways, but that some almost indistinguishable difference in my anatomy and psyche set me slightly, yet irrevocably, apart.”



“All human males were as fascinated with cars as they were with breasts.”

“… she gave me a look that deftly combined tenderness with revulsion. To this day the memory of that look still visits me like a Jehovah’s Witness: uninvited and tireless.”

“The fights are always the same”



“the important people in our lives leave imprints. they may die or go in the physical realm, but they are always there in your heart, because they helped form your heart”

“If you don't feel the same way about him, if you're just leading him on, you need to tell him that. I've seen too many nice guys get shafted because a girl can't get over some jerk.”



“You know what's lame, Pudge? I really care about her. I mean, we were hopeless. Badly matched. But still. I mean, I said I loved her... I mean, it's stupid to miss someone you didn't even get along with. but I don't know, it was nice, you know, having someone you could always fight with.”



“His arms wrapped around my waist from behind and he kissed my neck again, closer to the wound this time. My pulse accelerated. I wanted him to bite me; I wanted to be his.”



“As they embrace, she kisses him full on the mouth. And suddenly sticks her tongue right in. She has done this before, often. It’s one of those drunken long shots which just might, at least theoretically, once in ten thousand tries, throw a relationship right out of its orbit and send it whizzing off on another. Do women ever stop trying? No. But, because they never stop, they learn to be good losers.”



“I wear a necklace of hope with pearly beads. When I met you, it broke, and the beads spilled all over the floor, into the gutters.”



“We can help pave the roads of those around us, but we can't choose their direction.”



“Dropping in and out of your own life (for psychotic breaks, or treatment in a hospital) isn’t like getting off a train at one stop and later getting back on at another. Even if you can get back on (and the odds are not in your favor), you’re lonely there. The people you boarded with originally are far, far ahead of you, and now you’re stuck playing catch-up.”



“Siguro kaya naimbento ang salita’t konseptong closure ay para sa mga tinatamad malaman ang magiging wakas. Yung mga atat na atat malaman ang ending. Yung mga naburyong na sa pagkainip sa dapat kahinatnan. Kesa nga naman maghintay sa pagkahaba-haba’t pagkatagal-tagal ng ending, mabuti pang putulin nalang.”

“If she does not respect you, she will replace you.”

“If you have people who treat you badly in your life, they will be a human shield against people who will treat you well. If that’s not true then we should apply it to marriage and start saying to woman who are being put down or beaten, “you gotta stay with him because he needs you and he has been your husband for 20 years for heaven sakes. You just have to work to love him more and so on.” This is the advice they gave to woman like 200 fucking years ago and it was abusive advice.
I view the parent child relationship (This just not my made up perspective.) it is the least voluntary relationship. At least the woman who got married chose to get married. We don’t choose our parents. The highest standards of behavior are required for parents and no one else. There is no one else whose standards of behavior need be higher than parents and so often parents get away with the lowest possible standards of behavior with regards to their children.”

“I don't have the words to describe it, but it was like going on a journey with someone. Where didn't matter. To outer space. It went on for a long time. I started to fold down the corners of pages when there was a bit I really liked, and he started to write little comments in the margins. Just the odd word. 'Beautiful.' 'True.' That's the power of literature, you know, it can act like little love letters between people who can only explain their feelings by pointing at other people's.”



“Everybody is taken in at some period or another. [...] In marriage especially. [...] There is not one in a hundred of either sex, who is not taken in when they marry. Look where I will, I see that it is so; and I feel that it must be so, when I consider that it is, of all transactions, the one in which people expect most from others, and are least honest with themselves.”



“I had a dream about you last night.
We moved into a cabin in the countryside.
I couldn't handle the spiders.
You couldn't handle my drama.
I moved back to the city.”



“Whatever we say
We're always telling each other exactly what we want them to know...
We are always telling each other
The truth
Even when
We're lying”



“Look at someone every day for long enough and you stop seeing what everyone else sees. You start to see what no one else sees, what is kept hidden from most people.”



“I had a dream about you last night. It wasn't until after you sold me the talking car, I realized you were the world’s best ventriloquist.”



“This is what our love is––a sacred pattern of unbroken unity sewn flawlessly invisible inside all other images, thoughts, smells, and sounds.”




“Il n'y a rien de gentil à laisser de faux espoirs. L'ambiguïté est la source de la douleur.”



“Every relationship that has hit a crossroads has asked, “What is it that you want from me?”

“All over the world major museums have bowed to the influence of Disney and become theme parks in their own right. The past, whether Renaissance Italy or Ancient Egypt, is re-assimilated and homogenized into its most digestible form. Desperate for the new, but disappointed with anything but the familiar, we recolonize past and future. The same trend can be seen in personal relationships, in the way people are expected to package themselves, their emotions and sexuality, in attractive and instantly appealing forms.”



“Because two people in love don't make a hive mind. Neither should they want to be a hive mind, to think the same, to know the same. It's about being separate and still loving each other, being distinct from each other. One is the violin string one is the bow.”

“It made me realize how I needed to stop punishing her for something she couldn't help [...] because sometimes things happen to people and they're not equipped to deal with them.”



“The toxic behaviors were there before you decided to enter into relationships with them. The signs were there. You may have chosen to look the other way, but the signs were there.—”



“I am replete with stamina in finding out every single fact I can about this whole affair.
Yet, I think, do I want to pull that thread? Do I want to unleash the truth, unravel deceit, and kill reality as I´ve known it? It is irreparable, if I do, from the moment we met until now. It is long. If I discover too much that is false about what I thought my past was, Time will be skewed even further. I already have a poor connection with the present. Example: I have no sense of what day it is. It´s better.”



“So I put up with bad behavior in the name of loving the way I thought you were supposed to love.”



“We believe we are seeking happiness in love, but what we are really after is familiarity. We are looking to re-create, within our adult relationships, the very feelings we knew so well in childhood and which were rarely limited to just tenderness and care. The love most of us will have tasted early on came entwined with other, more destructive dynamics: feelings of wanting to help an adult who was out of control, of being deprived of a parent’s warmth or scared of his or her anger, or of not feeling secure enough to communicate our trickier wishes.
How logical, then, that we should as adults find ourselves rejecting certain candidates not because they are wrong but because they are a little too right—in the sense of seeming somehow excessively balanced, mature, understanding, and reliable—given that, in our hearts, such rightness feels foreign and unearnt. We chase after more exciting others, not in the belief that life with them will be more harmonious, but out of an unconscious sense that it will be reassuringly familiar in its patterns of frustration.”



“I just want you to know that where ever life takes you, I'll always be happy for you as long as its something that makes you happy because that's all that really makes me happy. Why? I'm just listening to my heart and all it's telling me is to understand. Which in a way I can but then again I can't. I'm use to it all though because not everyone lives a fair life if you know what I mean.”



“They ought to find out how to vaccinate for love, like smallpox.”



“Young girls often feel strong, courageous, highly creative, and powerful until they begin to receive undermining sexist messages that encourage them to conform to conventional notions of femininity. To conform they have to give up power.”



“Close cycles. Not because of pride or arrogance, but because that no longer fits your life”

“No one had told her this would happen, that her girlishness would give way to the solid force of wifehood, motherhood. The choices available were all imperfect. If you chose to be with someone, you often wanted to be alone. If you chose to be alone, you often felt the unbearable need for another body - not necessarily for sex, but just to rub your foot, to sit across the table, to drop his things around the room in a way that was maddening but still served as a reminder that he was there.”



“Let Love Rule”

“I want to tell him that it's just a stupid car, but bits of me are scattered all over town; the graveyard, school, Cassie's room, the motel, and standing in from of the sink in my mother's kitchen. It takes too much energy to gather all the bits together, so I just sit there and watch him implode. ”



“Nodding, Parker ate. “He’s an exceptional kisser.”
“He really is. He . . . How do you know?” When Parker just smiled, Emma’s jaw dropped. “You? You and Jack? When? How?”
“I think it’s disgusting,” Mac muttered. “Yet another best pal moving on my imaginary ex.”
“Two kisses, my first year at Yale, after we ran into each other at a party and he walked me back to the dorm. It was nice. Very nice. But as exceptional a kisser as he is, it was too much like kissing my brother. And as exceptional a kisser as I am, I believe he felt it was too much like kissing his sister. And that’s how we left it. I gather that wasn’t an issue for you and Jack.”



“Why?" She asked in a confused whisper. "Out of all the women in the world, why did you choose this mortal?"
"Because fate drove me to you.”



“Use the darkness of your past to propel you to a brighter future.”

“It’s funny how many ways there are to hurt people. As many ways to hurt as there are species of flower. Whole bouquets of hurt.”



“It sometimes seemed to him that for love to work, it had to be fair, that he should tell only half the joke, and she the other half. Otherwise, it would not be love, but something completely else–pity or entertainment, or stand-up comedy.”



“We returned to the hotel and had intercourse. I like that word
intercourse
. It poses only a limited range of possibilities.”



“We might have coupled
In the bed-ridden monopoly of a moment
Or broken flesh with one another
At the profane communion table
Where wine is spill'd on promiscuous lips
We might have given birth to a butterfly
With the daily-news
Printed in blood on its wings”



“It's the opposite of the collapse of the fantasy.
It's what happens when the illusion pales in comparison to the truth. I'm seeing her for the first time. Not Ava Garden Wilder, the rags-to-riches granddaughter of Clyde Jones. Not a tragic, romantic heroine.
Just Ava.
And I am utterly in love.”



“But, sometimes, especially late at night, when only the wind is awake with my thoughts, I feel an urgent need. I think of lacing up my tennis shoes and stepping out the door, already in a half run. I think of running and running forever, until I become part of the night sky. -The Art of Leaving”



“Just because the relationship ended doesn't mean it wasn't true or good or worth having. Everything expires eventually. Enjoy the good for what it was, not what it always has to be.”

“It was in those moments that I became one of them, one of the leavers. I'm leaving and I'm never coming back, I thought. It felt powerful. I finally felt in control. Is this how it felt to all the others. the leavers, the takers, the breakers? I became what they were. I could disappear. -The Art of Leaving”



“It's probably not easy for a woman to understand what it's like to be a man. Imagine you're starving, and someone puts a huge buffet in front of you. There's delicious, mouth-watering food all around you, and it's really really hard not to eat it all. That's what it's like to be a man around attractive women. The urge to want to hump everything that moves is part of a man's natural programming. It's a deep-seated hunger. To suppress that hunger takes civilization and a lot of willpower.”



“C'est un gars qui tombe amoureux, souvent, son piédestal est facile d'accès, mais doté d'une option "eject”



“When introverts go to church, we crave sanctuary in every sense of the word, as we flee from the disorienting distractions of twenty-first-century life. We desire to escape from superficial relationships, trivial communications and the constant noise that pervade our world, and find rest in the probing depths of God's love.”




“Love affairs are for emotional sprinters; the pleasures of love are for the emotional marathoners.”

“How could you do that to me?" I repeat. I don´t have to itemize. He knows what I speak of.
Eventually N produces three answers, in this order:
1. "Because I am a complete rotter." I silently agree, but it´s a cop-out:
I have maggots, therefore I am dead
.
2. "I was stressed at work and unhappy and we were always fighting...and you know I was just crazy..."
I cut him off, saying, "You don´t get to be crazy. You did exactly what you chose to do."
Which is true, he did. It is what he has always done. He therefore seems slightly puzzled at the need for further diagnosis, which may explain his third response:
3. "I don´t know."
This, I feel instinctively, is the correct answer. How can I stay angry with him for being what he is? I was, after all, his wife, and I chose him. No coincidences, that´s what Freud said. None. Ever.
I wipe my eyes on my sleeve and walk toward the truck, saying to his general direction, "Fine. At least now I know: You don´t know."
I stop and turn around and fire one more question: a bullet demanding attention in the moment it enters the skin and spreads outward, an important bullet that must be acknowledged.
"What did you feel?"
After a lengthy pause, he answers. "I felt nothing."
And that, I realize too late, was not the whole truth, but was a valid part of the truth.
Oh,
and welcome to the Serengeti
. That too.”



“The trouble with you is that the only way you can communicate is through art. You’ve never learned to communicate your feelings to a man. You don’t even want to communicate in a relationship. You think that if you open up to love, you’ll lose your independence or your self-expression or creativity or whatever you call all that passionate, wonderful stuff that makes you feel alive inside.”



“I love love. I love having a lover and being one. The insularity of passion. I love it. I love the way it blurs the distinction between everyone who isn't one's lover.”



“If truth doesn't set you free, generosity of spirit will.”

“...Love can give you the most exhilarating wonderful highs at times...
...Then there will be dives that will take all you have just to hold on...

Quote on the Title Page of "Love TORN Asunder”



“The vast desire and capacity a woman has for intimate relationships tells us of God's vast desire and capacity for intimate relationships. In fact, this may be The most important thing we ever learn about God--the He yearns for relationship with us. "Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God" (John 17:3). The whole story of the Bible is a love story between God and His people. He yearns for us. He cares. He has a tender heart.”



“Kiss me hot,heavy,wet & angry with that attitude like you do when your mouth yells it hates me but your tongue screams it can’t wait for me. Hug me, touch me, submit to me with that insatiable passion like you do when you thought you could leave but the sight of my throbbing rock hard love muscle made you too weak in the knees. Your mind is melting fast, your soul is whispering trust, your eyes are begging please and your anger has turned to lust. Let me undress your body, caress your skin and wetly massage your mind back into making love to me again. I’d rather say I’m sorry and keep my best friend than have this come to an end. Be encouraged but more importantly…be lethal with your make up love.”

“Just friends, just friends. Standing there in the bookstore, watching Seth walk away, I half wondered how anyone could still use that line. But I knew why, of course. It was used because people still believed it. Or at least they wanted to.”



“I dunno." She sat on the bench and hugged the robe like a pillow. "I still think that Brett guy is cute."
"Good luck getting him away from Bekka." Cleo gathered her silky black hair into a high pony and pink-dabbed Smith's Rosebud Salve on her lips. "She's got more grip than Crazy Glue."
"More cling than Saran Wrap," Lala added.
"More hold than Final Net." Cleo giggled.
"More possession than The Exorcist," Lala managed.
"More clench than butt cheeks," Blue chimed in.
"More competition than American Idol," Frankie stuck out her chest and showed them her diva booty roll.
The girls burst out laughing.
"Nice!" Blue lifted her purple gloved hand.
Frankie slapped it without a single spark.
"I hate to be a downer..." Claudine shuffled back into the conversation wearing her slippers and robe. "But that girl will destroy you if she catches you with Brett."
"I'm not worried," Frankie tossed her hair back. "I've seen all the teen movies, and the nice girl gets the boy in the end.”



“Yes. THANK YOU. And say hello to Judas Iscariot.”



“Because that's what unfaithfulness is, isn't it? A cancer that's always there in the back of your mind, eating away at the foundations of the relationship.”



“Unfortunately, he still hadn’t asked for my number, or a date, or my hand in marriage, and my drink was getting low.”



“Somewhere underneath it all, I know he doesn't deserve to take up space in my brain.”



“When you depersonalize abrasive behavior and see it as a call for help you become a catalyst for the best kind of change.”

“My life was dark, torture and empty before you found me. You brought the light, Red. I love you.”



“We all want relationships that are healthy and resolved, and sometimes that simply doesn't happen. But the beauty of life is that inside these disappointments are hidden the most miraculous of blessings. What we lose and what we might have been pales against what we have.”



“I kept loving and loving and loving. Every waking hour, I marveled on how these moments would make made me feel. I wanted to love the world and be the change it so deliciously craved.”

“When a clandestine couple kisses, it is much more likely that sex will immediately follow. This is because there is much more risk. Once you have kissed secretly, it is very difficult not to have sex. It would be impolite not to have sex. You have to show that you are serious about each other.”



“I had a dream about you last night. Eons ago, we created a Universe, then sat back and watched miniature versions of ourselves try to make all the same mistakes we did.”



“I’ve loved him since I’ve known him, Mrs. Daniels. He just finally stopped fighting.”



“So often, we had the tendency of saying, they're the problem. No, they're not the problem. Our heart is the problem. they are just there to show me what is in my heart. They don't put those things in my heart. They don't put the wrath, the bitterness in my heart. Those things are already there. They are the vessels God uses to to release what is in my heart so that I am aware of how black my heart really is.”

“There are many things that can keep you in a relationship. Fear of being alone, Fear of disrupting the arrangement of your life.A decision to settle for something that's okay. Because you don;t know if you can get any better. Or maybe there's the irrational belief that it will get better even if you know he won't change.”

“Men want a girl who looks like a boy. They want to protect her but she must be a survivor. And she must come...like a train...but with...elegance.”



“I had a dream about you last night... You replaced all the people in your life with kittens. It felt more like a prediction of the future.”



“I had a dream about you last night… it was raining and you were fishing for fire to set a sandcastle a flame.”



“I had a dream about you last night... you sat in a cardboard box and said you were a tree.”



“I had a dream about you last night... you were crying over spilt ink screaming "the words, the what could have been beautiful words.”



“I had a dream about you last night.. You pretended not to be a three hole punch.”



“I no longer have the energy for meaningless friendships, forced interactions or unnecessary conversations. If we don’t vibrate on the same frequency there’s just no reason for us to waste our time. I’d rather have no one and wait for substance than to not feel someone and fake the funk.”

“There are better people in the world, do not let the worst do the worst to you, you deserve the best in life.”

“I am unlovable...I have tried to involve myself in other people, in relationships, and even - in my sillier moments - in love. But it doesn't work. Something in me is broken or missing and sooner or later the other person catches me Acting or one of Those Nights comes along.”




“Each time a person passes by you and you say 'hello', imagine that person turning into a candle. The more positivity, love and light you reflect, the more light is mirrored your way. Sharing beautiful hellos is the quickest way to earn spiritual brownie points. You should start seeing hellos as small declarations of faith. Every time you say hello to a stranger, your heart acknowledges over and over again that we are all family.”



“Honey, nobody ever knows someone completely. You have to just enjoy what you do know and have faith in the rest.”



“She was aware that in love even the most passionate idealism will not rid the body's surface of its terrible, basic importance.”

“You cannot borrow half of who you are from someone else, yet people try to do it all of the time, they just call it a relationship!”



“I saw my reflection in their eyes, but not the men themselves, not clearly. This preserved the idea that all intelligent and even vaguely attractive men were essentially good. Delusion detest focus and romance provides the veil.”



“When culture is based on a dominator model, not only will it be violent, but it will frame all relationships as power struggles.”



“My Personality
unfolding before you
like a Swiss Army knife.”



“To listen is very hard, because it asks of us so much interior stability that we no longer need to prove ourselves by speeches, arguments, statements, or declarations. True listeners no longer have an inner need to make their presence known. They are free to receive, to welcome, to accept.
Listening is much more than allowing another to talk while waiting for a chance to respond. Listening is paying full attention to others and welcoming them into our very beings. The beauty of listening is that, those who are listened to start feeling accepted, start taking their words more seriously and discovering their own true selves. Listening is a form of spiritual hospitality by which you invite strangers to become friends, to get to know their inner selves more fully, and even to dare to be silent with you.”



“Oh, how wonderfully romantic of you. Romantics are really only in love with themselves.”



“She would be quiet at first. Then she would say a word about something small, something she had noticed, and then another word, and another, each one flung out like a little piece of sand, one from this direction, another form behind, more and more, until his looks, his character, his soul would have eroded away . . . I was afraid that some unseen speck of truth would fly into my eye, blur what I was seeing and transform him from the divine man I thought he was into someone quite mundane, mortally wounded with tiresome habits and irritating imperfections.”



“The three most important words in a relationship are not, 'I love you,' but, 'Tell me more.”

“To be yourself is in many ways to be inconvenient to others. Only placaters and appeasers get along with other people all the time and that's not really getting along with anyone. That's just self erasure.”

“Marriage," she said quietly, "is the most expensive ticket to nowhere”



“Sanity is not about confrontation. It's about filtering. Having a stable and happy life is about saying "no" to crazy people, not about inviting them in and then hoping that confrontations are going to make them sane.”

“The time to read Madame Bovary is when your romantic hopes and desires have crashed, and you will believe that your future relationships will have disappointing - even devastating - consequences.”



“Do you really think that I don’t have anything better to do than to spend my time thinking about you? Digging up a little of the goods on Luc Martineau?”
Fine lines appeared at the corners of his eyes and he laughed. “Sweetheart, there is nothing little about Luc’s goods.”



“Because conflict-avoidant Emily would never “bite” or even hiss unless Greg had done something truly horrible, on some level she processes his bite to mean that she’s terribly guilty—of something, anything, who knows what?”



“So you’re right, you don’t need me fighting your battles. But if you’ll let me, I’d like to be standing beside you as you fight them.”



“It’s amazing that relationships can form and last under the constraints of never fully knowing. Never knowing for sure what the other person is thinking. Never knowing for sure who a person is.”

“The two main girlfriends he has had wanted him to support them in the manner to which they certainly weren't accustomed even though he couldn't put his flabby hands on a penny.”



“I had a dream about you last night... you made a beard for yourself out of forty two bags of Twizzlers.”



“I believe the world is divided in three groups: givers, takers and the few that can balance both impulses. Giving and loving is a beautiful thing. It is the currency of compassion and kindness, it is what separates good people from the rest. And without it, the world would be a bleak place. If you are a giver, it is wise to define your boundaries because takers will take what you allow them to; all givers must learn to protect that about themselves or eventually, there is nothing left to give.”

“There are many forms of love as there is moments in time, and you are capable of feeling them all at different stages of your life.”

“The power of patriarchy has been to make maleness feared and to make men feel that it is better to be feared that to be loved. Whether they can confess this or not, men know that just is not true.”

“I have always wanted to give you the world, so I started giving you pieces of the oceans that kept us apart.”




“The more invested I am in my own ideas about reality, the more those experiences will feel like victimizations rather than the ups and downs of relating. Actually, I believe that the less I conceptualize things that way, the more likely it is that people will want to stay by me, because they will not feel burdened, consciously or unconsciously, by my projections, judgments, entitlements, or unrealistic expectations.”



“Our actions are guaranteed to affect others. Because we are not alone in this world, much of our learning about ourselves comes from our interaction with others. Our relationships are our teachers. We learn from each other.”



“But everything I have to give, I'll give to you”

“The person who wants out of the relationship always gets her way.”



“To get the most out of the relationship you are in, it won't be helpful to listen to the ego's stories about it. They will only bring separation and conflict. Essence would tell a different story about your loved one. It would probably be something like: "This person is in my life for me to love to the best of my ability. Let's see what happens if I do that." As Essence, we are here to serve others and serve life. The ego, on the other hand, is all about serving itself.”



“I just wouldn’t want to hook up with a guy unless I really, really like him, and in my
experience all boys can be classified as either assholes or bores, unless they’re both.
Maybe it’s a blessing, because the last thing I need is relationship drama to sidetrack me from my grades.”



“how anxiously I yearned for those I had forsaken.”



“Far from a normal-functioning relationship, but normal has never been our thing.”



“You'll need courage because polyamorous relationships can be scary. Loving other people without a script is scary. Allowing the people you love to make their own choices without controlling them is scary. The kind of courage we're talking about involves being willing to let go of guarantees - and love and trust your partners anyway.”



“Miles was still mourning the loss of his Romantic Plan. 'There was going to be champagne, and oysters, and you' -- he held out both hands as though shifting a piece of furniture -- 'were going to be sitting there, and I was going to get down on one knee, and...and...”



“If someone tries to use you as a tool, you shouldn't mind it, because it is their choice and folly, not yours.”



“Relationships with narcissists are held in place by hope
of a “someday better,” with little evidence to support it will ever arrive.”



“Commitment is another name for relationship not the compromise.”

“That feeling you get when you want to tell some one you love them, and there is no one there..”

“Give people time. Give people space. Don’t beg anyone to stay. Let them roam. What’s meant for you will always be yours.”

“But sometimes this hatred broke like a wave, unexplainably collapsing under its own weight, and before it would begin to well up again, she suddenly felt nothing but pure compassion for him, a kindness and forgiveness that almost broke her heart.”



“First impressions are rarely worth preserving. Men typically fall short of our expectations.”



“Some people have the coldest smiles, but have the tenderest hearts. And many have the most tender smiles, but carry the coldest hearts. You cannot judge a man by his smile, but you can judge a man by his heart. The smallest actions reveal the most about a hearts true color, so pay attention to them. Actions are the true words of the heart.”



“well I believe in commitment it's just I, you know, I don't stick to it.”

“She didn't want me; she wanted all of me. I didn't mind saying it. My girlfriend scared the crap out of me.”



“Make a list of all the imperfect people you’ve known in your life who have had love. Who have had romantic partners and best friends and jobs you could only ever dream of. Make a list of all the people who are conventionally unattractive and spiritually adrift and imperfect and all the things each one of them had despite being that way. Make it your own personal proof that you do not need to be perfect to be good enough.”



“Sports bars are also a great place for guys to meet other guys--either for sex or for wrestling, whichever feels more right. ”



“He knew very well that the great majority of human conversation is meaningless. A man can get through most of his days on stock answers to stock questions, he thought. Once he catches onto the game, he can manage with an assortment of grunts. This would not be so if people listened to each other, but they don't. They know that no one is going to say anything moving and important to them at that very moment. Anything important will be announced in the newspapers and reprinted for those who missed it. No one really wants to know how his neighbor is feeling, but he asks him anyway, because it is polite, and because he knows that his neighbor certainly will not tell him how he feels. What this woman and I say to each other is not important. It is the simple making of sounds that pleases us.”



“And if insight were sufficient, if the inner life were the whole of life, their happiness has been assured.”

“Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone.
Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.”



“Whatever it is that makes closeness possible between people also puts them in the way of hard feelings if that closeness ends.”

“Don’t ever stray from yourself, in order to be close to someone that doesn’t have the courtesy to remind you of your worth, or the integrity of a gentleman to walk you home.”

“Love is fickle and fleeting," Tsukiko continues. "It is rarely a solid foundation for decisions to be made upon, in any game.”




“It was the wildness of it that got me going: the primal lust, the sheer needs of two people in heat, quickly finding ways to express their sacred hunger to each other in animal passion.”



“people will forget what you said, people will forget what you do, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”

“The girls said she was too cynical about love, but how could you not be? On the surface, relations between men and women were all soft kisses and white gowns and hand-holding. But underneath they were a scary, complicated, ugly mess, just waiting to rise to the surface.”



“I have to figure out why I worked at a job I hated for years. I have to find out why I can’t see what everyone else sees in me. I don’t feel beautiful. When I look in the mirror, I never saw beautiful. For this to happen to someone like me, it’s devastating, Jonas. I don’t want you to think it’s vanity, it isn’t. I can’t see me and I need to be able to do that. I need to find out what I’m like and what I want. I have to be comfortable in my own skin before I can be in a relationship the way you want.”



“Real relationships - the kind that were supposed to last but never did - were more trouble than they were worth.”



“Fletcher was always going to be your ex-boyfriend, from the moment you met him. He's just finally caught up with where he's supposed to be.”



“You had to live in your own bubble. You couldn't force your way into someone else's, because then it wouldn't be a bubble any more.”



“Broken hearts, you can run, you can hide and perhaps the earth is big enough to believe you’re safe. So maybe for a moment you have escaped but hear me, hear me well. Love will find you and it will leave nothing behind.”

“The greatest adventure is to have no fear for the blaze that lies ahead.”

“There is a correlation between the number of days since a man last had sex, and, the number of things that he is willing to do for a woman.”

“One minute she acts like she wants to be with me and I'm the one rejecting her. The next, she's got this barbed wire fence and barking dogs around her, like I can't even ask her the simplest questions."
"And here I was assuming you didn't care about her."
Stabbing his fingers through his hair, he groaned, "I don't!"
"And you make it perfectly clear." Men. Idiots.”



“He reached out and intertwined our hands. Gently urging me forward he whispered, “Have I lost you love?”



“We’re only instruments of love, flowing through heaps of pain hoping one day we’d hatch a passion of our own.”

“
'Better to have loved and lost,' my ass.
Anyone parroting that little platitude had obviously never lost anyone of consequence.”



“Technically, on the spectrum of very bad things, they did nothing truly wicked. But of course, that spectrum has no measure for the greatest of all carnal sins, the kind that occurs before skin touches skin, before wondering turns to yearning, yearning to having, having to holding for dear life, when two people cling to each other so desperately that even when they lie, inches apart, neither is fully satisfied until the light between them turns to darkness.”



“Relationship doesn’t remain, We resonate on different flames, I could cut you down again, If you were like all other men, If you were like all other men, I know that I could shut you down again”

“I'm always looking for meaningful one-night stands”

“Sing me a love song in a slow, southern drawl to the tune of sunny days...”



“Deep down under where his heart resided, strangled up in thorny vines of guilt, anger, fear and longing, there lay something deeper in him, something that he couldn’t see but she could.”



“I could probably write a book on the complexities of our relationship, on my constantly shifting emotions, my ever-changing mind, but let's just say that nothing is ever as black and white as it seems, that love is not only blind but pathetic too. It can make us into victims and fools, reduce us to the kind of people who infuriate us on soap operas, the kind you want to scream at for allowing the creep or bitch to walk all over them.”



“The books we love offer a sketch of a whole universe that we secretly inhabit, and in which we desire the other person to assume a role.
One of the conditions of happy romantic compatibility is, if not to have read the same books, to have read at least some books in common with the other person—which means, moreover, to have non-read the same books. From the beginning of the relationship, then, it is crucial to show that we can match the expectations of our beloved by making him or her sense the proximity of our inner libraries.”



“When it comes to sex: some men treat women as objects; some women treat objects as men.”



“Falling in love is a wonderfully terrifying sensation.”

“Mend your speech a little, Lest you may mar your fortunes.”

“It was some time since I had gone to sleep in the same room with a girl. Of course, the room was large and reasonably well-lighted, and the girl had other things than me on her mind.”



“The Betty Lady explains love and splitting up: "It´s like playing the shell game with Jesus. You can´t figure anything out; it´s best not to try. You´ll just humiliate yourself.”



“This is the whole stupid thing about all these unblood relationships. They depend on people staying the same, standing in the same spot they were in over a decade ago, when they first met. Surely the reality is that connections between people aren't permanent, but fleeting and random, like a solar eclipse or clouds meeting in the sky. They exist in a constantly moving universe full of constantly moving objects.”



“If other people owe you an apology, and your words of apology to them are proper and heartfelt, you still may not hear from them for a while. After all, what are the odds that they get to the right emotional place to apologize at the exact moment you do? So just be patient. Many times in my career, I saw students apologize, and then several days later, their teammates came around. Your patience will be both appreciated and rewarded.”

“Psychoanalysis is often about turning our ghosts into ancestors, even for patients who have not lost loved ones to death. We are often haunted by important relationships from the past that influence us unconsciously in the present. As we work them through, they go from haunting us to becoming simply part of our history.”




“I hold a strict policy of automatic grudges against people everyone likes.”



“It is assured that men of all ages imagine a woman naked when they first meet.”



“For the first time in history, middle-class women do not need men in the traditional ways - for safety, for money, for a life. So they’re demanding instead what they always wanted but couldn’t ask for: emotional connection, presence, intimacy. Sex with enough foreplay, enough seduction, enough closeness to please them. Men are baffled not only because the needs they are being asked to fill differ so from what their fathers and grandfathers understood to be their jobs but also because full-fledged intimacy requires strengths and skills they’ve never learned. Moreover… they’re strengths and skills that were once left solely to women: Men didn’t have to develop them. This maturational mismatch may be contributing to distrust among lovers of all ages.”



“He opened his mouth to say that she looked extremely beautiful and deserved armfuls of roses, but the words were lost in committee somewhere, shuffled aside by the parts of his head that worked full-time at avoiding ridicule.”



“None of us, irrespective of our sexual preference and/or practice, imagine that we can have an intimate relationship with a partner and always have seamless harmony. Indeed, most of us assume that once the “honeymoon” period is over differences will emerge and conflicts will happen. Positively, we also assume that we will be “safe“ in those moments; that even if voices are raised and emotions expressed are intense, there will not be and should not be any abuse or any reason to be unsafe, and that the will to connect and communicate will prevail.”



“Ideally, of course, a relationship is best, but then how many people are capable of deep feeling? Practically none.”



“To love is to soar in the wild unexpectedly.”

“He found it both sad and fascinating that only through an artificial universe of video images could she establish contact with the real world.”



“Married women are far more depressed than married men -- in unhappy marriages, three times more; and -- interestingly -- in happy marriages, five times more. In truth, it is men who are thriving in marriage, now as always, and who show symptoms of psychological and physical distress outside it. Not only their emotional well-being but their very lives, some studies say, depend on being married!”

“North is a powerful man, and you're still connected to him." Flo frowned. "Probably sexual memory, those Capricorns are insatiable. Well, you know. Sea Goat. And of course, you're a Fish. You'll end up back in bed with him."
Andie slammed the car door. "You know what I'd like for Christmas, Flo? Boundaries. You can gift me early if you'd like.”

“I wonder
if you ever read my poems
and wish
they were written
for you.”

“So she stood naked in front of the young man and at this moment stopped playing the game.”



“So many men treat their wives badly, or indifferently, or with barely contained impatience. Josh doesn't mind-- no that's not right--he insists on openly showing his love and respect for me.”



“We're broken in complementary ways, thus rendering our damage comprehensible to each other.”



“The conventional parabola--sentiment, the touch of the hand, the kiss, the passionate kiss, the feel of the body, the climax in the bed, then more bed, then less bed, then the boredom, the tears and the final bitterness--was to him shameful and hypocritical.”



“By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”



“The thing about her is, she’s good-natured. He knew it the second he saw her standing by the parking meters. He could just tell from the soft way her belly looked. With women, you keep bumping against them, because they want different things, they’re a different race. Either they give, like a plant, or scrape, like a stone. In all the green world nothing feels as good as a woman’s good nature.”



“Pull a thread in my story and feel the tremor half a world and two millenia away.”



“Ah, sweetie. If the poets couldn’t unriddle them, then you certainly can’t. Be kind, and keep your ears on offer if she wants to talk. But you can’t draw out the strangeness, Edgar. It’s not a poison.”



“When a man I like touches my arm or my hair, I want to know if he'll touch the center of me, and whatever I learned in school--I went to school for a long time--I seem to believe that my center can be reached best with the tip of a penis....”



“(Georgie) Why is it that you always want to run after the one that goes off in a huff, and push away the one who is clinging to you?”



“When coming to sex: First served, first come.”

“A woman's weapon is her tongue.”



“One ends a romantic relationship while remaining a compassionate friend by being kind above all else. By explaining one’s decision to leave the relationship with love and respect and emotional transparency. By being honest without being brutal. By expressing gratitude for what was given. By taking responsibility for mistakes and attempting to make amends. By acknowledging that one’s decision has caused another human being to suffer. By suffering because of that. By having the guts to stand by one’s partner even while one is leaving. By talking it all the way through and by listening. By honoring what once was. By bearing witness to the undoing and salvaging what one can. By being a friend, even if an actual friendship is impossible. By having good manners. By considering how one might feel if the tables were turned. By going out of one’s way to minimize hurt and humiliation. By trusting that the most compassionate thing of all is to release those we don’t love hard enough or true enough or big enough or right. By believing we are all worthy of hard, true, big, right love. By remembering while letting go.”



“We played for about half an hour before I realized we were actually playing two different games. What I’d thought of as ludo was actually a game called gin rummy, and what Warren was playing seemed to be a mixture of craps and table tennis. Once we started playing by one consistent set of rules, though, the fun was really over.”



“we may not like it, but we need human friends, because we have human enemies whether we will or nay.”



“A second date always felt like an announcement at his age. And he never felt ready for the announcement.”



“What you know isn't nearly as important as who you know. Who will miss you. Who you will miss.”



“A man must at times be hard as nails: willing to face up to the truth about himself, and about the woman he loves, refusing compromise when compromise is wrong. But he must also be tender. No weapon will breach the armor of a woman's resentment like tenderness.”




“Men, you'll never be a good groom to your wife unless you're first a good bride to Jesus.”

“Listen she said, everything ends, every single relationship you will ever have in your lifetime is going to end.... I'll die, you'll die, you'll get tired of each other. You don't always know how it's going to happen, but it is always going to happen. So stop trying to make everything permanent, it doesn't work. I want you to go out there and find some nice man you have no intention of spending the rest of your life with. You can be very, very happy with people you aren't going to marry.”



“Anxiety and desire are two, often conflicting, orientations to the unknown. Both are tilted toward the future. Desire implies a willingness, or a need, to engage this unknown, while anxiety suggests a fear of it. Desire takes one out of oneself, into the possibility or relationship, but it also takes one deeper into oneself. Anxiety turns one back on oneself, but only onto the self that is already known.”



“There comes a time in some relationships when no matter how sincere the attempt to reconcile the differences or how strong the wish to recreate a part of the past once shared, the struggle becomes so painful that nothing else is felt and the world and all its beauty only add to the discomfort by providing cruel contrast.”



“He educated Maurice, or rather his spirit educated Maurice's spirit, for they themselves became equal. Neither thought "Am I led; am I leading?" Love had caught him out of triviality and Maurice out of bewilderment in order that two imperfect souls might touch perfection.”



“It is a matter of perspective, the difference between opponent and partner," Tsukiko says. "You step to the side and the same person can be either or both or something else entirely. It is difficult to know which face is true.”



“Do you love me Hero?" His pale green eyes were full of torment. "Do you love me like I love you?”



“I didn't want to leave things the way we had, unresolved, ... and tried to tell myself he cared about me enough not to look elsewhere for what I wasn't giving him.”



“He offered her power, money, status...
a giant prison, all in exchange
for only...her soul.”

“تتحدث النساء لنفس الاسباب التي يتوقف الرجال بسببها عن الكلام”

“However self-sufficient we may fancy ourselves, we exist only in relation -- to our friend, family, and life partners; to those we teach and mentor; to our co-workers, neighbors, strangers; and even to forces we cannot fully conceive of, let alone define. In many ways, we are our relationships.”



“Small animals are a great problem. I wish God had never created small animals, or else that He had made them so they could talk, or else that He'd given them better faces. Space. Take moths. They fly at the lamp and burn themsleves, and then they fly right back again. It can't be instinct, because it isn't the way it works. They just don't understand, so they go right on doing it. Then they lie on their backs and all their legs quiver, and then they're dead. Did you get all that? Does it sound good?"
"Very good," Grandmother said.
Sophia stood up and shouted, "Say this: say I hate everything that dies slow! Say I hate everything that won't let you help! Did you write that?”



“My boyfriends have all been as stoical as queen's guards. They'd been patient, committed, and dispassionate, and I'd had to really debase myself to extract any emotion, either grin or grimace, from them.”



“With him everything is a test, affection is measured, that given weighed against that which has been received, and the balance, more often than not, disappointing him.”



“To the degree you experience God's love towards you - seeing you as beautiful and radiant - to that degree sex won't ruin your life.”

“You know it’s a bad sign when the theme song from
Titanic
describes your relationship.”



“Women get into a relationship hoping a man will change, and he never does; men get into a relationship hoping the woman don't change, but she always does. Men want their partners to be consistent. That they won't make impromptu impossible demands nor baffle him with classically female sudden-onset hysterical behavior.”



“Then, whenever I feel the sun on my face, I will think of you, " I told him. "You will always be with me, Bill. Because of all I have felt for you, and all I have learned from you.”



“A man to whom a woman cannot look up, she cannot love. Yet, it is marvelous how a woman contrives to find something to look up to in a man.”



“Women have been brought up with the false sense that they have all the options in the world. We don’t understand that the culture really isn’t offering us all of these options – there still are very strong pressures to conform. We have to step outside the culture to be able to make choices that will really give us what we want. But we lack the psychic mechanisms to do this, to really choose.”

“As I’ve said, it wasn’t until a long time afterwards—long after I’d left the Cottages—that I realized just how significant out little encounter in the churchyard had been. I was upset at the time, yes. But I didn’t believe it to be anything so different from other tiffs we’d had. It never occurred to me that our lives, until then so closely interwoven could unravel and separate over a thing like that.
But the fact was, I suppose, there were powerful tides tugging us apart by then, and it only needed something like that to finish the task. If we’d understood that back then—who knows?—maybe we’d have kept a tighter hold of one another.”



“She understands suddenly that the stuff that fills her up is not the love or attention she might get from other people; it is the love she herself has for other people. We are, Portia decides, the people we love”



“Between Countess Nordston and Levin there had been established those relations, not infrequent in society, in which two persons, while ostensibly remaining on friendly terms, are contemptuous of each other to such a degree that they cannot even treat each other seriously and cannot even insult each one another.”



“As I walked inside, she turned around and headed for the end of the bed. Then she paused and turned to face me. She was wearing her Orchard Hill basketball T-shirt and sweatpants and she looked tired, but beautiful.”



“I wanted intimacy in caps lock but I got it in parentheses. We curled into each other, upside down, my empty spaces filled by another. "Give me the three minute version of your life story," he said. I nailed it it one then refused to throw the question back as etiquette governs. He wanted to know where I'd been. I wanted to know who he was.”



“I review what I know once again, confronting the monolith now alien and almost unconnected to me: my marriage.”



“(Peter) If you don't share the lows, it seems you might stop sharing the highs as well.”



“A girl should set her sights on a man who has money; or if not, who can expect to come into money; or if not, who has moneyed connections.”



“That's the problem with relationships," George was saying. "It's a contract. You agree to be some unchanging caricature of yourself. To act the same way all the time. Never to change. It's counter-evolutionary. How can anything new and good come into your life, if you're holding on to something that doesn't exist anymore?”



“When someone you love makes compassion, kindness, forgiveness, respect and God an option, you can be sure they have made you an option, as well.”

“Bravery is the choice to show up and listen to another person, be it a loved one or perceived foe, even when it is uncomfortable, painful, or the last thing you want to do.”

“
The only person that should wear your ring is the one person that would never…
1.	Ask you to remain silent and look the other way while they hurt another.
2.	Jeopardize your future by taking risks that could potentially ruin your finances or reputation.
3.	Teach your children that hurting others is okay because God loves them more. God didn’t ask you to keep your family together at the expense of doing evil to others.
4.	Uses religious guilt to control you, while they are doing unreligious things.
5.	Doesn't believe their actions have long lasting repercussions that could affect other people negatively.
6.	Reminds you of your faults, but justifies their own.
7.	Uses the kids to manipulate you into believing you are nothing. As if to suggest, you couldn’t leave the relationship and establish a better Christian marriage with someone that doesn’t do these things. Thus, making you believe God hates all the divorced people and will abandon you by not bringing someone better to your life, after you decide to leave. As if!
8.	They humiliate you online and in their inner circle. They let their friends, family and world know your transgressions.
9.	 They tell you no marriage is perfect and you are not trying, yet they are the one that has stirred up more drama through their insecurities.
10.	They say they are sorry, but they don’t show proof through restoring what they have done.
11.	They don’t make you a better person because you are miserable. They have only made you a victim or a bitter survivor because of their need for control over you.
12.	Their version of success comes at the cost of stepping on others.
13.	They make your marriage a public event, in order for you to prove your love online for them.
14.	They lie, but their lies are often justified.
15.	You constantly have to start over and over and over with them, as if a connection could be grown and love restored through a honeymoon phase, or constant parental supervision of one another’s down falls.
16.	They tell you that they don’t care about anyone other than who they love. However, their actions don’t show they love you, rather their love has become bitter insecurity disguised in statements such as, “Look what I did for us. This is how much I care.”
17.	They tell you who you can interact with and who you can’t.
18.	They believe the outside world is to blame for their unhappiness.
19.	They brought you to a point of improvement, but no longer have your respect.
20. They don't make you feel anything, but regret. You know in your heart you settled.”

“Ladies! I encourage you NOT to be so easily flattered by what a man has. Be flattered by his strength, courage, integrity, and character as a man. Be impressed by his ability to be honest, faithful, loving, and respectful to you. Be impressed because he can communicate and openly express his feelings. Be impressed because he’s got confidence, direction, and purpose in his life. Be impressed because he’s a quality man, NOT a fine man. Real Talk!”

“Real relationships are the product of time spent, which is why so many of us have so few of them.”

“At least there's nothing scary about him and hopefully he doesn't see anything scary in me. We go way back, to summer camp. We KNOW each other. People I don't know just make me want to say YIKES! I'll take history over mystery any day of the week.”




“Not every marital union is going to be a meaningful and fulfilling experience.
Most of marriages today are nothing more than poorly or well managed coexistence.”

“their respect for the mystery--the half-grasped but never spoken idea that maybe, when you got right down to the place where the cheese binds, there is no such
thing
as marriage, no such thing as union, that each soul stood alone and ultimately defied rationality. That was the mystery.”



“There is tremendous trauma in the betrayal caused by a perpetual liar as they repeatedly commit psychological abuse.”



“Closure
/klōZHər/ Noun
1. The thing women tell you what they want, but secretly they really want you to tell them why you don’t want them again, so they can try one last time to convince you that you were wrong.
2. The warped mentality that having someone tell you honestly why they don’t want you is going to somehow make you feel peace, so you can move on.
3. The neat packaging of finishing conversations because you have been stewing over it insecurely about the length of what a stalker does.
4. The one thing women don’t give themselves because if they didn’t care about the jerk they wouldn’t still be hanging onto another conversation that tells them what they already know: He just isn’t that interested in you.
5. The anal retentive art of perfecting every ending with meaning, rather than just excepting you went through something rather sucky and he doesn’t care.
6. The act of closing something with someone, when in reality you should slam the door.”

“I thought I would prefer apathy over this," I confided to her. "Why?" she asked. "Are you saying you would rather be cold than comforted? He's looking at you and offering his hand in friendship and you're rudely looking away pretending not to notice. At least with him you wouldn't be so alone." I felt my eyes turn into colorless pools as I glared at her for stating the obvious. "Being numb to someone is better than feeling something," I explained. "Safer you mean," she interrupted. I sighed and continued, "When someone who was once significant in your life comes back after an extended absence, emotions you had finally freed yourself from are reawakened, and if that's not enough to contend with, dormant memories are summoned whether you want them to be or not." "And what is it that you want?" she posed triumphantly. I swallowed my anger and thought with defeat, "Nothing anyone can give me.”

“To share out your soul freely, that is what metanoia (a change of mind, or repentance)really refers to: a mental product of love. A change of mind, or love for the undemonstrable. And you throw off every conceptual cloak of self-defense, you give up the fleshly resistance of your ego. Repentance has nothing to do with self-regarding sorrow for legal transgressions. It is an ecstatic erotic self-emptying. A change of mind about the mode of thinking and being.”



“Is disinterest not the essence of every human relationship?”



“I can only do what's easy. I can only entice and be enticed. I can't, and won't, attempt difficult relations. If I marry it will either be a man who's strong enough to boss me or whom I'm strong enough to boss. So I shan't ever marry, for there aren't such men. And Heaven help any one whom I do marry, for I shall certainly run away from him before you can say 'Jack Robinson.”



“I arrived, I saw humans and I saw through their faces. Nothing ever changes but the light in their eyes. For I too have buried my demons today, without knowing what might remain beneath the face of tomorrow.”

“That cake tasted good. But the cake in the garbage tasted better. It was the best cake I ever ate.”



“Exposure to erotically inclined stimuli immediately activates parts of a male brain that are associated with sexual desire. Being attracted to other women, however, doesn’t mean men would betray the trust they are given and harm the partnership with the women they love.”

“Kate lost a mother," I said, "but I lost a nothing."
Kate doesn't feel that way," Jack assured me.
But what about everybody else besides Kate? How can I ever explain to anyone what she was when she and I had no name? People need names for everything. I wasn't a relative or a friend, I was just an object of her kindness."
He wiped my cheeks, saying
Ssshh
. I buried my face in his shoulder.
True kindness is stabilizing," I went on. "When you feel it and when you express it, it becomes the whole meaning of things. Like all there is to achieve. It's life, demystified. A place out of self, a network of simple pleasures, not a waltz, but like whirls within a waltz."
You're the one now," Jack said definitively. "That's why you met her. She had something she had to pass on." (p. 95)”



“You're still in it. You'll always be in it. No, not literally. But in your heart. Nothing ever ends, not if it's gone that deep. You'll always be walking wounded. That's the only choice, after a while. Walking wounded, or dead. Don't you agree?”



“God can take the ordinary and create the extraordinary. Our incredible God has the power to transform your simple life and give you the life of your dreams. Remarkable things happen in your life when you believe.”



“You want him praising the Lord in the morning, you put a smile on his face tonight.”



“Excessive praise arises from the same bigotry matrix as excessive criticism.”

“What I want to impart through our correspondence is that no matter what anyone may be going through, here's the thing: If you love each other, and if your relationship is worth the pain or the hardship, stay with it. The extraordinary treasure of sharing another person's life is one of the most gratifying experiences of being a human being.”



“Breaking the circle”
My eyes darken when I see my new lover. Fresh prey.
My body doesn’t really react in a sexual way.
It’s the devil inside me that celebrates next conquest.
We exchange meaningless sweet words.
His hungry gaze penetrates my breasts and ass.
Another drink and laughter.
And then another one.
Sometimes I get very drunk or high.
And then I don’t feel him between my legs.
I don’t see his sweating face.
I don’t hear his moans and questions if I came.
I can’t stay sober when I cheat on you.
I’m such a coward that I can’t even face this inner monster.
It consumes me, it takes away my dignity.
It makes me do horrible things.
It hurts you, the only one who ever loved me.
Who knows what I really am.
No. It’s not the monster. It’s me. I am the whore.
I dig my nails into your soft flesh until it bleeds.
I am the one pushing you away, feasting on your kindness.
I blame those hard punches of my past for my infidelity.
Those cruel hands. Those hateful words.
I try not to, I really do.
I try to be a better person.
But how can I if I am just nobody?
You know why I leave. Yet you stay. You’re there when I’m back.
With your sorrow and cry and resentment and wrath.
Why?
If I’m broken because of my pain what’s your excuse?
Why do you keep letting me treat you like a stray dog?
Don’t you have any respect for yourself?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
And just when I think I have my own slave for life you break the circle.
You shut the door with a grimace of relief.
You can’t look at me anymore.
See, you’re finally free!
My inner innocent girl is happy for you.
But the monster inside kicks and laughs at me.
I’m left alone.
I dress up and go hunting.”



“I had begun to feel that life was a repetition of the same thing; that there was nothing new either in me or in him; and that, on the contrary, we kept going back as it were on what was old.”



“If that’s the case, I understand why emotions are hard for you. You’ve numbed yourself to make room for the grief you carry.”



“The person you love has all kinds of seeds in her: joy, suffering, and anger. If you water her anger, then in just five minutes you can bring the anger out in her. If you know how to water the seeds of her compassion, joy, and understanding, then these seeds will blossom. If you recognize the good seeds in her, you are watering her self-confidence and she will become the source of her own happiness as well as yours.”



“It's hard to admit that a marriage might be over when the love is still there. People are led to believe that a marriage ends only when the love has been lost; when anger replaces happiness when contempt replaces bliss. But Graham and I aren't angry with each other, we're just not the same people we used to be.”

“Relationships fail when people take their own insecurities and project them as their partner's flaws.”

“If you spend time judging and criticizing people, you will not have time to heal from your pain or brokenness. You cannot love yourself when you judge or criticize others who are created in God's image and after His Likeness...in which you are also created. Love cannot operate from a space of pain. Love and hurt cannot reside in the same space.”



“When clouds of pain loom in the sky
When a shadow of sadness flickers by
When a tear finds its way to the eye
When fear keeps the loneliness alive
I try and console my heart
Why is it that you cry? I ask
This is only what life imparts
These deep silences within
Have been handed out to all by time
Everyone’s story has a little sorrow
Everyone’s share has a little sunshine
No need for water in your eyes
Every moment can be a new life
Why do you let them pass you by?
Oh heart, why is it that you cry?”

“My God, these folks don't know how to love -- that's why they love so easily.”

“Men are not dogs. We merely think we are and, on occasion, act as if we are. But, by believing in our nobler nature, women have the amazing power to inspire us to live up to it.”




“Women rescue men just as much as, if not more than, men rescue women.”



“If you expect honesty, be honest. If you expect forgiveness, forgive. If you expect a whole person, you have to be a whole person.”



“Perhaps the depth of love can be calibrated by the number of different selves that are actively involved in a given relationship.”



“It hurts to let go. Sometimes it seems the harder you try to hold on to something or someone the more it wants to get away. You feel like some kind of criminal for having felt, for having wanted. For having wanted to be wanted.”

“people have character strength but they lack communication skills, and that undoubtedly affects the quality of relationships as well.”



“Our moments are music, and sometimes – just sometimes – we can catch them and put them into some lasting form. If we didn’t have music, I don’t think we could ever be truly happy, and if we didn’t have special moments, we would never find music.”



“First she would try to kill him, but failing this give him food and her body, breast-feed him back to a state of childishness and even, perhaps, feel affection for him. Then, the moment he was asleep, cut his throat. The synopsis of the ideal marriage.”



“If you stay in the company of anger, pain, or hurt, happiness will find someone else to visit. Make the choice to view all of your past relationships as a gift. Throw out what hasn’t worked in the past and incorporate new concepts. Focus on being happy﻿.”



“These guys may not talk too much about relationships, but they sure do blush at telling moments, don’t they? Maybe that’s the key to understanding the opposite sex; I could invent a science, call it blushology.”



“Because that’s what unfaithfulness is, isn’t it? A cancer that’s always there in the back of your mind, eating away at the foundations of the relationship. It’s happened once, it could happen again, so you’re always looking for telltale signs or symptoms to show that it’s reappeared...”



“What? Did we end up hating each other? Did we end up the way we thought we always knew would? Did I end up wearing khakis because of that fucking ad?”



“The women we really love are the women who complete us, who have the qualities we can borrow and so become something nearer to whole men. Just as we complete them, of course; it’s not a one-way thing. Leola and I, when romance was stripped away, were too much alike; our strengths and weaknesses were too nearly the same. Together we would have doubled our gains and our losses, but that isn’t what love is.”

“I know my vision is impaired and cannot be trusted with even the simplest tasks, much less dating. Not that I´ve come within talon distance of a man.”



“It all comes down to that one person you always think about before you fall asleep at night. And text "Good Morning" as soon as you wake up.”

“Never give a lousy person the opportunity to create lousy babies.”



“He is not the same person as when we
met, but . . . neither am I. Time has refined us, but instead of pushing us apart, we’re closer than ever.”



“Regardless of whether a relationship brings us joy or sorrow, each relationship gives us the opportunity to grow stronger, nobler, and more compassionate with ourselves and others.”

“When I am lonely for boys what I miss is their bodies. The smell of their skin, its saltiness. The rough whisper of stubble against my cheek. The strong firm hands, the way they rest on the curve of my back.”



“Love is more about being the right person than finding the right person.”



“I wept for relationships not possible due to denial and dreams locked in the back of people’s minds, all of the bits of life that lay dormant until the babblings of televisions and nursing homes sweep them away. It makes me wonder how many of the dreams we had originally have already been forgotten.”



“I´ve blown it, the whole grisly charade.”



“You can never recover from losing a person you love, but you can find a way to let it be part of your life rather than letting it take over every part of you”



“Your relationships will take you beyond the boundaries of your normal strength. Encouragement gives struggling people eyes to see the unseen Christ.”



“Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home.”



“I had a dream about you. You were crying, and I couldn’t tell if it was because you were sad or because you’d been laughing too hard. So I decided to find out by telling you that I’d just heard from the cops, and your mother had been murdered. Before I got to the punch line you started sobbing in a different manner, so I realized you’d been laughing earlier. By that time the mood had changed, and I decided it best not to deliver the punch line after all. So I sat down next to you and put my arm around you and tried to console you for your perceived loss.  ”



“I help others because I can, not because I expect something in return.”



“Robots are like Mars: they need
girls.
Boys won't do;
the memesoup is all wrong. They stomp
when they should kiss
and they're none too keen
on having things shoved inside them...
It's not a robot
until you put a girl inside. Sometimes
I feel like that.
A junkyard
the Company forgot to put a girl in.”



“The thing that binds us together is that we have both lowered our expectations of life”




“About halfway through I broke down crying, which I hadn't expected. I was a little ashamed, but only a little;it was her, you see, and she never taxed me with the times that I slipped from the way I thought a man should be...the way I thought I should be, at any rate. A man with a good wife is the luckiest of God's creatures, and one without must be among the most miserable, I think, the only true blessing of their lives that they don't know how poorly off they are.”



“Christopher McCandless:"I will miss you too, but you are wrong if you think that the joy of life comes principally from the joy of human relationships. God's place is all around us, it is in everything and in anything we can experience. People just need to change the way they look at things.”

“Walk together. Feel the heart beats. Experience the presence. This is how to be thankful.”

“Some women do not masturbate for pleasure; they masturbate to make a political statement: to remind us that women do not really need men (or at least not as much and as frequently as every single male chauvinist and every single misogynist believes).”



“When women are secret they are secret indeed; and more often then not they only begin to be secret with the advent of a second lover.”



“Relationships are never static. They have to evolve over time as the individuals in them change.”



“We spend so much time on the whole world instead of on those who really need us, in a world where rumours are a trend and truth is an afterthought.”



“No relationship is without its difficulties and this is certainly true when one or both of the persons involved has an autistic spectrum disorder. Even so, I believe what is truly essential to the success of any relationship is not so much compatibility, but love. When you love someone, virtually anything is possible.”



“Do you know where your breakthrough begins? Your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends.”



“An apple tree is just like a person. In order to thrive, it needs companionship that's similar to it in some ways, but quite different than others.”



“Nurturing, Providing, and loving you passionately. May that be, my number of responsibilities. As one to the end, forever more. That's how long I desire, our love to last for. Providing for you many and joyful memories. In hours of darkness, as well as brightness. I plan to supply for you. For your love for me and happiness, is all that matters to me.”



“It's early days. A few skeletons are bound to keep jumping out of the closet.”



“How much do you love me?"
She drew in a breath and let it out. "Too much."
"Too much is just enough for this man."
"And do you love me?" she whispered.
"I have always loved you. Always. You know that.”



“The desire for connection with the Divine and our formless inner self is at the foundation of all desire for human connection.”

“Be careful… not all are what they seem. Some people pretend to be the beach, but they’re actually quicksand.”

“I found, increasingly, that I did not particularly care and I tried to fake a little kindness, a little sweetness, tried to mirror Luna back at herself, but that exhausted me after a week and I concluded that I was not meant for this sort of thing, friends, friendliness, no, I wasn't meant for it.”



“He did not want an affair with his boss. He did not even want a one-night stand. Because what always happened was that people found out, gossip at the water cooler, meaningful looks in the hallway. And sooner or later the spouses found out. It always happened. Slammed doors, divorce lawyers, child custody.”



“His love for me seemed to overflow my limits by its flood of wealth and service. But my necessity was more for giving than foe receiving; for love is a vagabond, who can make his flowers bloom in the wayside dust, better than in the crystal jars kept in the drawing-room.”



“Quand on parle des vices d’un homme, si on vous dit : “Tout le monde le dit” ne le croyez pas ; si l’on parle de ses vertus en vous disant encore : “Tout le monde le dit”, croyez-le.”

“I shall never cease to marvel at the way we beg for love and tyranny.”



“I loved being near you. Even though I felt that bubble you had around you, even though I never quite knew what you were thinking, damn, did I love being near you. Somehow, I knew you would rip me apart and drown me. Somehow, I knew we wouldn’t last. It didn’t matter. You were my sun. I loved feeling you upon me, around me, between me. Even though you could only love me from a distance, I didn’t care. I never felt more warmth inside of me than when you were against me.”

“The blame of course belonged to Clyde, who just was not much given to talk. Also, he seemed very little curious himself: Grady, alarmed sometimes by the meagerness of his inquiries and the indifference this might suggest, supplied him liberally with personal information; which isn't to say she always told the truth, how many people in love do? or can? but at least she permitted him enough truth to account more or less accurately for all the life she had lived away from him. It was her feeling, however, that he would as soon not hear her confessions: he seemed to want her to be as elusive, as secretive as he was himself.”



“There is no one so cruel as those closest to you.”

“I think you should know,' he says. 'I like you. Like I shouldn't. That sort of like.”



“When she had failed once or twice to respond to some conversational gambit or other, Bond also relapsed into silence and occupied himself with his own gloomy thoughts.”



“But my best friend from college was silent for a long time. She, of all of my friends, had seen the parade of sad wrecks through my life, date after bad date after bad boyfriend. She was the one who'd picked up the pieces after the musician, the investment banker, the humanitarian who was human to everyone but me.
When at last she spoke, she said, Oh, hell.
And, after that: Hallelujah.”



“I love you in the future tense: I will love you, tomorrow and the day after and the day after that until there are no more days left for us.”



“If you abandon yourself in order to be in a relationship, you cannot be in a relationship”



“We read not only because we cannot know enough people, but because friendship is so vulnerable, so likely to diminish or disappear, overcome by space, time, imperfect sympathies and all the sorrows of familial and passional life.”



“The moment you put someone on a pedestal they will look down upon you. The trick is respecting each other equally.”

“SELFLESS LOVE.
If you have a special person in your life, but you find yourselves arguing, irritated and/or fighting out of the blue… you both need to try to step back and be selfless and think of the other person... with no ego of your own. No ego. We are ALL dealing with our own tough issues. We may keep them to ourselves, but we all have struggles. If you BOTH allow yourselves to step into each others shoes- to have the awareness and respect for each others issues and struggles... that will most likely allow the love that you have for each other to shine through at its brightest.
There will be ups and downs- feelings of being under-appreciated for both. It will happen. But let that be the worst that happens. Unity through diversity. That's the greatest love. A selfless love. It’s paradoxical, but you each would get back more than you give out. That's the love that conquers all things that’s mentioned in the Bible. It will be challenging for both of you, but well worth it.”

“We imagined we knew everything the other thought, even when we did not necessarily want to know it, but in fact, I have come to see, we knew not the smallest fraction of what there was to know.”




“Public truth telling is a form of recovery, especially when combined with social action. Sharing traumatic experiences with others enables victims to reconstruct repressed memory, mourn loss, and master helplessness, which is trauma's essential insult. And, by facilitating reconnection to ordinary life, the public testimony helps survivors restore basic trust in a just world and overcome feelings of isolation. But the talking cure is predicated on the existence of a community willing to bear witness. 'Recovery can take place only within the context of relationships,' write Judith Herman. 'It cannot occur in isolation.”



“I am getting nowhere with you and I can't let you go and I cant get through.”

“Security comes first from inside of you. Then, if you are very lucky, you will be in a position to find other people who also possess that same sort of security, and build some sort of family or community as a team.”



“When a man cheats, it is said it is because he is a dog. When a woman cheats, it is said it is because her man is a dog.”



“Emancipation of women has made them lose their mystery.”

“Beauty is in the heart of the beholder.”



“If you listen closely, silence can be deafening.”



“Delusions are hardly an escape from reality. It’s a way of understanding insane people living in a backwards world.”

“I hate everything about her except for the fact that I love everything about her.”



“If you really love someone. You wouldn't hide them. You would be proud to let the whole world know that you have feelings for that special someone. If I got asked who do I love. I would straight up say the name. Just imagine how special that person would feel to know that you aren't afraid or embarrassed to let everyone know that person means a lot to you. However, sometimes its understandable especially when you have your friends or family against it. Which to me shouldn't matter because it's your life and we only live once. Even if it doesn't work out, we grow from our own experiences, right?”

“Well, clearly someone you trust isn’t really someone you should be trusting,” she said without thinking, and regretted it when Terrible glanced at her. He did it fast, just a quick cut of his eyes in her direction and then away again, but she saw it. She felt it. It was starting already. She wished she could say she was surprised, wished she hadn’t been waiting for it, expecting it the way she expected rain from black clouds overhead. Nothing in the world was permanent, especially not happiness. She’d always known that. She just wished life would stop proving her right.”



“Sex can lead to nasty things like herpes, gonorrhea, and something called relationships.”

“We are responsible for our own relationships, their successes, their failures, the good times, the bad times. Take responsibility for creating the relationships that you desire.”

“I don't know," she said. "We used to squabble a lot when we were going together and then engaged and everything, but I thought everything would be so different as soon as you were married. And now I feel so sort of strange and everything. I feel so sort of alone.”



“Straight between them ran the pathway,
Never grew the grass upon it”



“I was living and dying in all the fibers of what is chewed and digested and in all the fibers that absorb the sun, consuming and digesting. Under the thatched arbor of a restaurant on a river-bank, where Olivia had waited for me, our teeth began to move slowly, with equal rhythm, and our eyes stared into each other's with the intensity of serpents'—serpents concentrated in the ecstasy of swallowing each other in turn, as we were aware, in our turn, of being swallowed by the serpent that digests us all, assimilated ceaselessly in the process of ingestion and digestion, in the universal cannibalism that leaves its imprint on every amorous relationship and erases the lines between our bodies and sopa de frijoles, huachinango a la vera cru-zana, and enchiladas.”



“All positive interactions with other human beings involve, to some degree, the experience of visibility-- that is, the experience of being seen and understood.”

“My mother had always taught me to write about my feelings instead of sharing really personal things with others, so I spent many evenings writing in my diary, eating everything in the kitchen and waiting for Mr. Wrong to call.”

“There's always something in it for the person who is allowing to be taken advantage of." Psychotherapist David in Type 1 Sociopath”



“There is no guilt in feelings ever.”



“I had a day when I was busy in the world, where the activity created a turmoil on the surface of my consciousness like waves on the surface of the ocean, which made it difficult to see through the waves to the inner silence.
It reminded me that we need to develop both the capacity to use the mind when engaged in activity and social relations, and to be able to let go of the activity and to come in contact with the deep inner silence.
The relationship between being active in the world and in social relations and the inner silence is like the relationship between the waves on the surface of the ocean and the deep inner silence on the bottom of the ocean.”



“I had a dream about you. In my dream I stole all your money, kidnapped your parents, and mailed you mannequin parts spray-painted red in a series of packages that also included ransom notes. Then, towards the end of the dream, the cops surrounded my cave and swarmed in to arrest me. Sweating, my eyes shot open, and I realized it was a dream. “Of course it’s a dream,” I thought. “The cops have no idea where my cave is, and your first package has yet to be delivered.” ”



“How do people know they are sane? Can a person be gripped by lunacy, only to be released a short time later, never to relive the episode again?”



“The greatest testament of a life lived is to be missed when you are gone. It is not something you can plan for or buy ahead of time. It is a sentiment that comes freely from the lives you touch in positive ways.”

“Or maybe I, like, cuddle raped him or something.”



“...човек невинаги може да възстанови личните си граници, след като е допуснал да бъдат размити и прекрачени от друго човешко същество в процеса на романтична връзка: колкото и да се опитваме не можем да възвърнем онази автономност на личността, която сме си въобразявали че притежаваме”



“I was lucky to meet you, yes.'
'Me too . . .' she said, looking me in the eyes. 'I was lucky too. The men I know are a disaster, not one of them believes in love; so they give you this big spiel about friendship, affection, a whole load of stuff that doesn't commit them to anything. I've got to the point where I can't stand the word 'friendship' any more, it makes me physically sick. Or there's the other lot, the ones who get married, who get hitched as early as possible and think about nothing but their careers afterwards. You obviously weren't one of those; but I also immediately sensed that you would never talk to me about friendship, that you would never be that vulgar. From the very beginning I hoped we would sleep together, that something important would happen; but it was possible that nothing would happen, in fact it was more than likely.' She stopped and sighed in irritation.”



“we all make vows, Jimmy. And there is something very beautiful and touching and noble about wanting good impulses to be permanent and true forever," she said. "Most of us stand up and vow to love, honor and cherish someone. And we truly mean it, at the time. But two or twelve or twenty years down the road, the lawyers are negotiating the property settlement."
"You and George didn't go back on your promises."
She laughed. "Lemme tell ya something, sweetface. I have been married at least four times, to four different men." She watched him chew that over for a moment before continuing, "They've all been named George Edwards but, believe me, the man who is waiting for me down the hall is a whole lot different animal from the boy I married, back before there was dirt. Oh, there are continuities. He has always been fun and he has never been able to budget his time properly and - well, the rest is none of your business."
"But people change," he said quietly.
"Precisely. People change. Cultures change. Empires rise and fall. Shit. Geology changes! Every ten years or so, George and I have faced the fact that we have changed and we've had to decide if it makes sense to create a new marriage between these two new people." She flopped back against her chair. "Which is why vows are such a tricky business. Because nothing stays the same forever. Okay. Okay! I'm figuring something out now." She sat up straight, eyes focused somewhere outside the room, and Jimmy realized that even Anne didn't have all the answers and that was either the most comforting thing he'd learned in a long time or the most discouraging. "Maybe because so few of us would be able to give up something so fundamental for something so abstract, we protect ourselves from the nobility of a priest's vows by jeering at him when he can't live up to them, always and forever." She shivered and slumped suddenly, "But, Jimmy! What unnatural words. Always and forever! Those aren't human words, Jim. Not even stones are always and forever.”




“When we are passionately in love with our Prince, we put Him above all else--not just in theory, but also practically, in every moment of our day-to-day lives. We do not live for the applause of heaven. Our longings are not for people's approval but only for more and more of Him. We are marked by an effortless, unshakable strength that is found in the presence of our perfect Lover.”



“When I speak of life and love as expanding with age, sex seems the least important thing. At any age we grow by the enlarging of consciousness, by learning a new language, or a new art or craft (gardening?) that implies a new way of looking at the universe. Love is one of the great enlargers of the person because it requires us to "take in" the stranger and to understand him, and to exercise restraint and tolerance as well as imagination to make the relationship work.”



“I´m just not sending out the right vibe lately. Perhaps the fact that I wear stained sweatpants and free T-shirts is holding me back. I just can´t seem to get back into the intelligent-slut-for-hire outfits that lure men; even shoes with laces evade me. Plus my hair is Fran Lebowitz-esque. I think my eyes are getting closer together. I don´t know.”



“Finally he turned his head toward her face and brushed a kiss over her cheek. “I love you and I believe with all my heart that you love me as well. Why can’t you say it, Hero?”



“Where does love go? When something you have taped on the wall falls off, what has happened to the stickum? It has relaxed. It has accumulated an assortment of hairs and fuzzies. It has said "Fuck it" and given up. It doesn't go anywhere special, it's just gone. Energy is created, and then it is destroyed. So much for the laws of physics. So much for chemistry. So much for not so much.”

“
You get what you give,"
we will tell his sorry, selfish ass." The Betty Lady has spoken. I detect a Bronx accent.
"But," I demur, "it will make the other woman say, ´See? She IS a jealous and paranoid and pushy wife.´"
The Betty Lady rips open a cell phone statement with a nail file and, without looking up at me, says, "Let me tell you something, honey. In my experience? The only thing they care about is what they see in the mirror each morning and WINNING...or their perception of winning.”



“The teaching of the sexual tantras all come down to one point. Although desire, of whatever shape or form, seeks completion, there is another kind of union than the one we imagine. In this union, achieved when the egocentric model of dualistic thinking is no longer dominant, we are not united with it, nor am I united with you, but we all just are. The movement from object to subject, as described in both Eastern meditation and modern psychotherapy, is training for this union, but its perception usually comes as a surprise, even when this shift is well under way. It is a kind of grace. The emphasis on sexual relations in the tantric teachings make it clear that the ecstatic surprise of orgasm is the best approximation of this grace.”



“Without such trust and safety, social relationships tend to become strategic rather than cooperative, increasingly full of skepticism and even anxiety and fear about others' intentions. (p. 27)”



“There's a cover for every pot, but I've never seen so many mismatched pots and covers in all my life. - Ellen Wasserfeldman, from Notes from Ellen Wasserfeldman by Alisa Dana Steinberg”



“Playing roles in any relationship is false and will inevitably lead to the relationship's collapse. Noone can be any one thing all the time.”



“Jack hadn’t thought of love as a promise before—a promise that, even when the world was falling down around him, would stay kept. But without Sutton saying a word, he knew that there would be comfort when he couldn’t sleep tonight. And tomorrow and the day after, there would be a home to go to, even if it was no more than a pair of arms around him and a head tucked close to his in the darkness.”



“I have never understood why a woman must have a man to take her into dinner.”



“I could hardly get a boy to look at me. All right, they'd look, they'd even take me out, but no one asked for a second date. I was too nasty, a real wise guy, and all the boys could tell what my rotten disposition was. Deep down, I wanted a commitment with a capital C. To get anywhere with me, a boy would have to sign his undying loyalty with his own blood.”



“My guess is that he remembers some of me, some of us together, and the rest rolled off him like topsoil in a flash flood.”



“Sand castles just aren't made to last.”



“When I was your age, if a boy behaved badly, one simply scored his name out from one's dance card.

“Oh, you want me to lie still while you check me out? Damn, Red, if I'd have known that earlier I would've been horizontal already.”



“You have to shrink yourself to fit into this little life with him.”

“Darling, whose book is this to be?"
"Ostensibly yours, my sweet"
"I see -- rather like my life since I met you?"
"Yes darling”



“In this quiet place on a quiet street
where no one ever finds us
gently, lovingly, freedom gives back our pain.
--from poem In a Quiet Place on a Quiet Street”



“To know other people thought he'd made a mistake vindicated me. I wasn't a bad girlfriend, he was simply going through a period of temporary insanity and he'd come to his senses soon.”



“To be honest, going out with Ed after Josh is like moving on to Duchy Originals super-tasty seeded loaf after plastic white bread. (I don't mean to be rude about Josh. And I didn't realize it at the time. But it is. He is. Plastic white bread.)”



“This was one of those moments when I realized that my emotional baggage, once a few neatly packed pieces, was now like the Joads' truck, stacked high with old clothes, half a rocking chair, a mule, all barely secured with twine.”



“I think we’re romantic people in some ways, but when it comes to relationships it’s not a question of ‘Can you trust another human being?’, so much as a question of trusting yourself. The animalistic nature of man seems to mean that you’re bound to find another people physically attractive. And there’s something dishonest about shutting those feelings off - it seems puritanical to deny yourself that. The idea of sin is still so widely pervading.”

“The kiss intimately relates to the most primitive kind of human contact, which can satisfy all of our needs, like: feeding, enjoying pleasure, tasting, wanting, rejecting, everything we associate with love.”

“People frequently point to communication as a problem, because its easy to notice, but usually it is a symptom of an underlying problem with a relationship posture.”



“And deep down, she felt like maybe she didn't deserve it-that she belonged with the petty thieves and guys who drank Pabst Blue Ribbon for breakfast”

“We tried to act familiar, which meant we couldn't ask the kind of questions that might have helped us figure each other out and year after year the distance grew.”



“Guilt is a feeble emotion. It surrenders too easily”



“Your blessings are very important to melt down the stony hearts.”




“..begin by talking about the kind of existentialist chaos that exists in our own lives and our inability to overcome the sense of alienation and frustration we experience when we try to create bonds of intimacy and solidarity with one another. Now part of this frustration is to be understood again in relation to structures and institutions. In the way in which our culture of consumption has promoted an addiction to stimulation - one that puts a premium on packaged and commodified stimulation. The market does this to convince us that our consumption keeps oiling the economy for it to reproduce itself. But the effect of this addiction to stimulation is an undermining, a waning of our ability for qualitatively rich relationships.”



“You can't compare men or women with mental disorders to the normal expectations of men and women in without mental orders. Your dealing with symptoms and until you understand that you will always try to find sane explanations among insane behaviors. You will always have unreachable standards and disappointments. If you want to survive in a marriage to someone that has a disorder you have to judge their actions from a place of realistic expectations in regards to that person's upbringing and diagnosis.”

“Be real and be unashamed, even of your faults. I do truly know what my husband is made of and vice versa. ”

“....whatever else remained the same, the light had changed, and you cannot find the pearly dawn at noonday. The fact is unalterable, that a fellow-mortal with whose nature you are acquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few imaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen in the continuity of married companionship, be disclosed as something better or worse than what you have preconceived, but will certainly not appear altogether the same.”



“Relationships that are merely based on practicality or utility will ultimately make us feel lonely.”

“Behind every 'I love you', there is an invisible 'until'.”

“I wanted, for so long, for someone to understand me better than I understood myself, to take control of me, to save me, to make it all better. I thought that the hardest part of a loving, mutually healing relationship would be showing my vulnerable, raw spots to a person, even though I'd been hurt so many times before. This has not been the hardest part. The actual hardest part has been realizing that no one, no matter how compassionate and kind they are, will say the perfect things always. Myself included. The hardest part has been learning to communicate what I need, to hear what others need, to tell others how to tell me what they need. Intimacy takes a lot of communication. We all have triggers. I don't know your triggers and you don't know mine. No matter how much I love or trust you, you cannot possibly know exactly the words I need to hear, the words I don't want to hear, and the way I like to be touched. And how strange that we expect these things of each other. How strange, and self-sabotaging, that we refuse to get into relationships and friendships with people unless they treat us in just that perfect way. We've been raised to want fairy tales. We've been raised to wait for flawless saviors to rescue us. But the savior isn't flawless and the savior is not coming. The savior is you. The savior is still learning. The savior is never done learning. The savior is a human being. Forget perfect. Forget flawless. And start speaking your truth. Start speaking what you want and how you want it. And start asking and listening, really listening, to what the people around you say. Maybe, then, we will stop abandoning and hurting each other. Maybe, then, there's hope for us.”

“Your ability to make me feel like I was less than I was, took awhile to recover from. But after ripping my own self worth to shreds for so long, I realized that I wasn't less just because I was more than your inexperienced hands could handle.”



“There was a warmth of fury in his last phrases. He meant she loved him more than he her. Perhaps he could not love her. Perhaps she had not in herself that which he wanted. It was the deepest motive of her soul, this self-mistrust. It was so deep she dared neither realise nor acknowledge. Perhaps she was deficient. Like an infinitely subtle shame, it kept her always back. If it were so, she would do without him. She would never let herself want him. She would merely see.”



“For better or for worse, but not for lunch,...”



“When we don’t tell those we love about what’s really going on or listen carefully to what they have to say, we tend to fill in the blanks with stories.”



“(Her husband's departure ...) had picked Mildred up by the hair and dropped her down at the doorstep of insanity.
From "Butterfly on F street”

“He should in humility have asked her why it was that he was naturally a cuckold, why two women of different temperaments and characters had been inspired to have lovers at his expense. He should be telling her, with the warmth of her body warming his, that his second wife had confessed to greater sexual pleasure when she remembered that she was deceiving him.”

“It had all seemed as inevitable as sunset. Instead it was the beauty of the sun glinting upon the scythe.”



“That fist he was raising at me would wham into the cupboard door, hurting only himself. I saw it all happening, then it really did happen. But I didn't understand the whore thing. Why was he confusing the drinking with the other? Then I got it. Obvious. It was all mixed up for him, all the same thing: the drinking, the other, anything that could make a woman free.”

“A while back, when Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like, Barry proposed the idea of a questionnaire for prospective partners.”



“A human being basically could not live alone. I had always thought of one’s soul as an imperfect creature; God had created it that way to allow the need to exist –the need to have relationships with other people in order to always run after the one obsession that had humanity seeking it on regular basis –perfection. Whether that relationship was between family members, friends, co-workers or even a romantic relationship, it was always people’s way to achieve flawlessness since they couldn’t accomplish it on their own.”



“When he had promised himself that he wouldn't try to repair Jude, he had forgotten that to solve someone is to want to repair them: to diagnose a problem and then not try to fix that problem seemed not only neglectful but immoral.”



“عشقه که آدما ابله میکنه یا فقط ادمای احمق عاشق میشن؟”



“Two birds went for dating. The male bird was killed and the female bird is being murdered.”

“The truth is, that one doesn't really know anything about anybody. Not even the people who are nearest to you...'
'Isn't that going a little too far--exaggerating too much?'
'I don't think it is. When you think of people, it is in the image you have made of them for yourself.”



“And she realized everything one does is just another effort to be understood by someone a little bit more.”



“I look forward to the day that I can feel nothing but indifference for you. Just like you were able to do from the moment that you walked away.”

“You shine like love
You shine like hate
until I can’t remember the difference”



“I went back to my room and spent all night contemplating whether it was possible in life not to be constantly let down. If it could ever be worth pinning your happiness to another person, when all other people ever seemed to do was disappear.”



“It was blissful, spending time with someone who would leave you alone. I loved him for it. And I was happy to repay in kind. It had never occurred to me that leaving someone alone could harden into a habit that could become a barrier.”



“Mindfulness won’t ensure you’ll win an argument with your sister. Mindfulness won’t enable you to bypass your feelings of anger or hurt either. But it may help you see the conflict in a new way, one that allows you to break through old patterns.”



“Sometimes, no matter how hard we try for someone and hope that they will get better in time – they never do. Abusive relationships shouldn’t have a key to your chambers of heart. Hold your key and keep it close. Don’t end up getting addicted to such pain or human beings – for that matter. You might not be Thor but they can surely be Loki & hold you prisoner to their trickster nature.”



“Love is as much a question of the will as it is of the emotion. And if you will to love somebody, you can. - Ravi Zacharias' brother”



“Those who make conversations impossible, make escalation inevitable.”

“True confidence is not about what you take from someone to restore yourself, but what you give back to your critics because they need it more than you do.”

“The most empowering relationships are those in which each partner lifts the other to a higher possession of their own being.”

“I hope you outlive me so I never have to know what life is like without you.”




“عقدة أوديب"
مرحلة في تطور الطفل بين ثلاث سنوات إالى ست سنوات تتميز برغبة الطفل في الاستئثار بأمه، لكنه يصطدم بواقع أنها ملك لأبيه، مما يجعل الطفل في هذه المرحلة من تطوره التي تمتد من السن الثالثة إلى التاسعة يحمل شعورا متناقضا تجاه أبيه: يكرهه ويحبه في آن واحد جراء المشاعر الإيجابية التي يشمل بها الأب ابنه. تجد عقدة أوديب حلها عادة في تماهي الطفل مع أبيه. لان الطفل لا يستطيع ان يقاوم الاب وقوته فانه يمتص قوانين الاب وهنا ياتى تمثل عادات وافكار وقوانين الاب في قالب فكرى لدى الطفل يرى فرويد أن السمات الأساسية لشخصية الطفل تتحدد في هذه الفترة بالذات التي تشكل جسر مرور للصغير من طور الطبيعة إلى الثقافة، لأنه بتعذر امتلاكه الأم يكتشف أحد مكونات القانون متمثلا في قاعدة منع زنا المحارم.
لهذه العقدة رواية أنثوية إن جاز التعبير، يسميها فرويد بعقدة إلكترا تجتاز فيها الطفلة التجربة نفسها، لكن الميل يكون تجاه أبيها. كما للعقدة نفسها عند فرويد رواية جماعية تتمثل في أسطورة اغتيال الأب التي يعتبرها منشأ للعقائد والأديان والفنون والحضارة عموما.”

“Never hesitate to let the one you love know how you feel. Align your minds, synchronise your hearts and above be fearless when dancing with their souls.”



“Then I met Linda and the sun rose.
I can't find a better way to express it. The sun rose in my life. At first, as dawn breaking on the horizon, almost as if to say, this is where you have to look. Then came the first rays of sunshine, everything became clearer, lighter, more alive, and I became happier and happier, and then it hung in the sky of my life and shone and shone and shone.”



“In choosing a mate, don't pick the tallest and most handsome or the most beautiful. Don't choose one just because that person raises your physical passions. Look for the person who is good from within, the one with substance and worth.”

“Women Empowerment Reminder of The Day. Always respect yourself as a woman. You attract what you are, so be very mindful of how you’re representing yourself. If you want respect, you must first learn how to respect yourself, first. Attracting negative attention is never a good thing. Be a woman of substance! Be a woman that both women and men respect, admire, and look up to. Don’t disrespect yourself by lowering your standards and accepting just anything that comes your way. It’s okay to be single! If you want a relationship of substance, you can’t keep entertaining people and things that mean you no good. Think about it! It’s all up to you.”

“It was masturbation, not willpower, that made it possible for gazillions of women to walk down the aisle with their reputation and their hymen still intact.”



“A relationship will either make the majority of your life happy or miserable. It is important to take your time and make sure that it is a wise choice before making a commitment.”



“I had a dream about you. I was a ventriloquist trying to share your fashion secrets, but you wouldn’t talk. So we put on a strip show for the department store sale, and I was arrested for theft – I took away your dignity as a mannequin”



“The more a woman appreciates the hunting prowess of her man, the more he will kill for her.”



“Strong relationships come from well-bonded friendships.”

“We must admit that simply knowing the contents of the Bible is not a sure route to spiritual growth. There is an aweful assumption in evangelical churches that if we can just get the Word of God into people's heads, then the Spirit of God will apply it to their hearts. That assumption is aweful, not because the Spirit never does what the assumption supposes, but because it excused pastors and leaders from the responsibility to tangle with people's lives. Many remain safely hidden behind pulpits, hopelessly out of touch with the struggles of their congregations, proclaiming the Scriptures with a pompous accuracy that touches no one. Pulpits should provide bridges, not barriers, to life-changing relationships.”



“That happens a lot with Shakespeare. The women go after what they want; the men wind up suckered into things.”



“Let's hope that for every time that we get hurt or break our heart, there is something somewhere being written to make up for it, to make the happiness due even bigger and laughters even merrier, for after all good things must happen to good people.”

“...It's just nice to see you out from his shadow. Because things don't grow in the shadows, you know? So it was frustrating to see you standing there...and really cool to see you step out of it. I don't know who this new guy is, but make sure when you're with him, you're not standing in his shadow. Stand where everyone can see you.”



“Life is too short to not kick fear in the ass and allow yourself to love again.”



“I asked if you was pleased.’
‘Course I’m pleased! You think I’d be mad if I wasn’t pleased?’
‘You don’t make a lick of sense,’ he says, but he is smiling now and he takes a step closer to me.”



“Every day I’m convinced that I can’t possibly love you more… and every day I’m proven wrong.”

“Some women have been faking orgasms for so long that they sometimes fake one when they are masturbating.”



“Every specific human being, however, thinks, judges, imagines, wills and expresses himself or herself in a unique, dissimilar, and unrepeatable mode--a mode of unpredictable difference, or otherness, which objectively defies description or delimitation.”



“The bottom line was that I was in an abusive relationship.”

“Hmm. Relationships between fathers and sons can be notoriously difficult, especially for two men who are as different as you and your father are."
"Yes, and he's also the king--that makes our relationship impossible.”



“She is my friend, and there is nothing you can say or do that can stop me from helping her.”

“You are set free whenever you love—even those who believe you're crazy.”



“KM: Yes. Mrs. Lopez, she's human. And you know, clearly, she'd like people to show some appreciation for her hard work. But if people just, you know, take her pie and don't even say, "Hey, nice pie," they just scarf it down or whatever-
MH: I could see how that would get to be annoying. I mean, if you're constantly providing...pie. And getting no positive feedback-
KM: Right! And what about your future? I mean, how do you know people are still going to want your pie in the future? Supposing they become a famous rock star or something. People are going to be offering them pie all over the place. If they haven't promised only to eat your pie, well, where does that leave you?”



“Maybe it's impossible to find everything you want in one person. Maybe everyone in your life gives you certain things you need. And your friends give you the rest of what you can't get from your boyfriend.”



“Everyone is the right person for the right person.”

“It's disconcerting to realize how little you have to say to someone who once occupied such a prominent place in your bed.”




“Yet even in the loneliness of the canyon I knew there were others like me who had brothers they did not understand but wanted to help. We are probably those referred to as "our brother's keepers," possessed of one of the oldest and possible one of the most futile and certainly one of the most haunting instincts. It will not let us go.”



“Sometimes I feel like relationships consist of telling your same life stories to different people until someone finally appreciates them.”



“Even after centuries of human interacting, children still continue to rebel against their parents and siblings. Young marrieds look upon their in-laws and parents as obstacles to their independence and growth. Parents view their children as selfish ingrates. Husbands desert their wives and seek greener fields elsewhere. Wives form relationships with heroes of soap operas who vicariously bring excitement and romance into their empty lives. Workers often hate their bosses and co-workers and spend miserable hours with them, day after day. On a larger scale, management cannot relate with labour. Each accuses the other of unreasonable self-interests and narrow-mindedness. Religious groups often become entrapped, each in a provincial dogma resulting in hate and vindictiveness in the name of God. Nations battle blindly, under the shadow of the world annihilation, for the realization of their personal rights. Members of these groups blame rival groups for their continual sense of frustration, impotence, lack of progress and communication. We have obviously not learned much over the years. We have not paused long enough to consider the simple truth that we humans are not born with particular attitudinal sets regarding other persons, we are taught into them. We are the future generation's teachers. We are, therefore, the perpetrators of the confusion and alienation we abhor and which keeps us impotent in finding new alternatives. It is up to us to diligently discover new solutions and learn new patterns of relating, ways more conducive to growth, peace, hope and loving coexistence. Anything that is learned can be unlearned and relearned. In this process called change lies our real hope.”



“It seemed funny that one day I would go to bed in her arms and the next not feel anything, like a switch had gone off. But no, that wasn’t honest either. This had been building for a long time. Our silences were getting longer. Our arguments more frequent. How do you stay with someone when there are no dreams to build? No purpose to accomplish? No meaning? No meaning —that was the monster that drove us away from one another in the end. Always.”



“It struck her all at once that dealing with other human beings was an awful lot of work.”



“You can trust everyone to be human, with all the quirks and inconsistencies we humans display, including disloyalty, dishonesty and downright treachery. We are all capable of the entire range of human behavior, given the circumstances, from absolute saintliness to abject depravity. Trusting someone to limit their sphere of action to one narrow band on the spectrum is idealistic and will inevitably lead to disappointment.
On the other hand, you can decide to trust that everyone is doing their best according to their particular stage of development, and to give everyone their appropriate berth. For this to work, you have to trust yourself to make and have made the right choices that will lead you on the path to your healthy growth. You have to trust yourself to come through every experience safely and enriched. But don’t trust what I am saying. Listen and then decide for yourself. Does this information sit easily in your belly? You know when you trust yourself around someone because your belly feels settled and your heart feels warm.”



“Her violence frightened me. She always claimed that I was the jealous one, and I was often jealous, but when I saw things working against me I simply became disgusted and withdrew. Lydia was different. She reacted. She was the Head Cheerleader at the Game of Violence.”



“We can't talk about it, or I know she won't so I don't even try, but it's what goes unsaid between people tat builds up like masonry. You have to either knock the bricks out with other things, or let them keep stacking until eventually you are alone in a room.”

“Loving relationships, though necessary for life, health, and growth, are among the most complicated skills. Before we can be successful at achieving relationships, it is necessary that we broaden our understanding of how they work, what they mean and how what we do and believe can enhance or destroy them. We can accomplish this only if we are willing to put in the energy and take the time to study failed relationships as well as examine successful ones. Loving relationships cannot be taken lightly. Unless we are looking for pain, they must not be forever approached in a trial and error fashion. Too many of us have experienced the cost of these lackadaisical approaches in terms of tears, confusion and guilt.”



“Instructions For Wayfarers
They will declare: Every journey has been taken.
You shall respond: I have not been to see myself.
They will insist: Everything has been spoken.
You shall reply: I have not had my say.
They will tell you: Everything has been done.
You shall reply: My way is not complete.
You are warned: Any way is long, any way is hard.
Fear not. You are the gate - you, the gatekeeper.
And you shall go through and on . . .
—Alexandros Evangelou Xenopouloudakis,
THIRD WISH”



“Friendship is not by force but by choice.
You can never please everybody, he who aims to please everybody will end up pleasing nobody.”



“Yes,” said Mamma, “this is the worst of life, that love does not give us common sense but is a sure way of losing it. We love people, and we say that we are going to do more for them than friendship, but it makes such fools of us that we do far less, indeed sometimes what we do could be mistaken for the work of hatred.”



“A real relationship doesn't properly begin until the NRE burns away. That's when you have to start dealing with this person as an all-around human being, replete with irritating little habits. When disillusion sets in, love can begin.”



“You do not get what you wish for, unless it be known to the source of your desire.”



“I went to bed without reading, instead staring out my window with the curtains drawn, wondering about boys. Why did they behave so oddly? One minute their teasing was relentless, and then
bam!
― they’d stun you with a thoughtful gesture. Either way, their actions made you want to cry. Maybe that was the intent.”



“When your tears become invisible, disappear”

“There's nothing wrong with wanting to be with someone."
"There is when your only reason is the being, not the someone.”

“If you stay in the company of anger, pain, or hurt, happiness will find someone else to visit.”



“But I do not know what to tell myself. Stuart needs "space" and "time," as if this were physics and not a human relationship.”

“Sound crazy? It may well be, but it is precisely in relationships of intimacy that your craziness (and mine) will be hardest to conceal. p.215”



“most men know what they hate; few what they love”

“In the mainstream, with its illusion of unlimited relational possibilities, we can counter dissatisfaction in relationships by simply moving on in search of the "right people." But community...demands we cultivate friendships with people we might not choose ordinarily. Founding friendship on commitment rather than "chemistry" often requires adjustment...At the end of the day, however, we have found that any loss of chemistry in relationships is more than made up for with gains in meaning.”

“Katie says, "You can't choose the time and place the when and where with whom you fall in love."
She says, "It just happens like that weird feeling you get right before you fall asleep when you gasp in surprise because your muscles just relaxed and you feel like you are falling."
She says, "Marcie, you shouldn't worry about it -- give it time to actually happen."
I guess --
I worry that I won't do it right.
That it'll be the wrong time, the wrong place, the wrong person.”

“Never enter relationships. Otherwise, suffer the pains that come with it. Enjoy your individuality while you can.”



“(In reference to swingers) In the meantime, if you wish to declare yourself polyamorous, get used to the fact that the confusion is gong to remain as a pejorative. Sure, clear up the misunderstanding as much as you can, but don't put too much effort into setting yourself up as a "good", responsible, community-oriented polyamorist by contrasting yourself to the "bad" swingers - they may not be your siblings, but they're definitely your cousins.”



“She re-read his email four times, feeling offended and breathless, like he had casually grabbed her head and stuffed it into a pile of wet leaves.”



“She knew breaking up with Ethan was going to be a full-time job because being in a relationship with him had also been a full-time job.”



“For me, it´s sloth," I say. "Hedonistic sloth and escapism.”



“This is what we do. Not so much argue as joust, in jest. We can't stop pushing and pulling the taffy of words and concepts.”



“When one has let go of that great hidden agenda that drives humanity and its varied histories, then one can begin to encounter the immensity of one's own soul. If we are courageous enough to say, "Not this person, nor any other, can ultimately give me what I want; only I can," then we are free to celebrate a relationship for what it can give.”




“What the trees can do handsomely-greening and flowering, fading and then the falling of leaves-human beings cannot do with dignity, let alone without pain.”

“How can I expect readers to know who I am if I do not tell them about my family, my friends, the relationships in my life? Who am I if not where I fit in the world, where I fit in the lives of the people dear to me?”



“The early church was strikingly different from the culture around it in this way - the pagan society was stingy with its money and promiscuous with its body. A pagan gave nobody their money and practically gave everybody their body. And the Christians came along and gave practically nobody their body and they gave practically everybody their money.”

“Argumentation is a human enterprise that is embedded in a larger social and psychological context. This context includes (1) the total psyches of the two persons engaged in dialogue, (2) the relationship between the two persons, (3) the immediate situation in which they find themselves and (4) the larger social, cultural and historical situation surrounding them.”



“As important as your obligations as a doctor, lawyer or business leader will be, you are a human being first. And these human connections with spouse, with children and with friends are the most important investments you will ever make. At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict, or closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child or a parent. One thing will never change. Fathers and Mothers, if you have children, they must come first. You must read to your children, you must hug your children and you must love your children…. Your success as a family, our success as a society depends not what happens at the White House, but what happens inside YOUR house.”

“There are persons whom in my heart I despise, others I abhor. Yet I am not obliged to inform the one of my contempt, nor the other of my detestation. This kind of dissimulation...is a necessary branch of wisdom, and so far from being immoral...that it is a duty and a virtue.”

“I couldn't take much more of this. Being the object two men competed for wasn't as glamorous as it sounded in the movies. The two men who both wanted one hundred percent of my time weren't dashing, international playboys. They were undead and surprisingly immature, considering the youngest was just over a hundred years old.”



“He mentioned the connection between us. He identified with me. These are the things that many people want to hear, that most “normal” people want to be able to truthfully say, but almost no one can.”



“But then you hear that he can't hear you, you see that he can't see you. You are not here--and you haven't even died yet. You see yourself through his eyes, as The Generic Woman, the skirted symbol on the ladies' room door.”



“They can talk shit about each other behind the others' backs, but when it comes down to it, money is the one true race and everyone down here is the color of greenbacks and as tall as mountains.”



“Betsy hadn't had sex, actual; sex-sex, full sex, in two hundred and fifty-three days. She decided on her thirty-seventh birthday that she wouldn't sleep with anyone unless it was in the context of a committed relationship which had some sort of future, and she was only gradually coming to the realization of what happens when a woman her age makes a decision like that: she never has sex again.”



“It takes two to have a fight.”



“If you worked out enough, maybe the man would too. Maybe you would be able to work it out together, as if the two of you were a puzzle that could be solved; otherwise, one of you, most likely the man, taking his addictive body with him and leaving you with bad withdrawal, which you could counteract by exercise. If you didn't work it out it was because one of you had the wrong attitude.”



“Judging Natalie as my mother had judged me was, I felt like telling her son, just my ass-backward way of showing love. I'd spent my life trying to translate that language, and now I realized I had come to speak it fluently. When was it that you realized the thread woven through your DNA carried the relationship deformities of your blood relatives as much as it did their diabetes and bone density? ”



“It is 10 PM now, and Godzilla has been sitting at his desk in front of his laptop for six to seven hours. He has accomplished hardly anything today. Godzilla is drinking a lot of beer. He can not stop smoking cigarettes. His room is blue with cigarette smoke, and Godzilla sits on a chair in there, minimizing and maximizing Mozilla Firefox repeatedly. He is not over his girlfriend's house because she said on the cell phone that she needed time, alone, to think about their relationship. Godzilla worries that he will not be able to take care of himself if they break up.”

“Don't be too busy climbing the ladder of success and forget your most cherished relationships (friends, family, spouse, etc). EnjoyLife!”

“Still, she really did seem to be absurdly into this. It was almost existentially unsettling, that two people in such close physical proximity could be experiencing the same moment so differently.”



“Each new year is another chance to get love right.”



“Look for the positive qualities in your client's negative behavior.”

“Mom has the Touch. She knows what flowers go with what occasions, what hors d'oeuvres work with what people. She believes passionately in the power of food to heal, restore, and stimulate relationships, and she has built a following of loyal customers who really hope she's right. If she's wrong, says Sonia, no one wants to know.”



“I didn't want to pick at Micah and me until we unraveled. I wanted to leave it alone and enjoy it. I just didn't know how to do that.”



“It [realization of Oneness] means being constantly open to the possibility that we are like two flowers looking at each other from two different branches of the same tree, so that if we were to go deep enough inside to the trunk, we would realize that we are one. Just being open to this possibility will have a profound effect on your relationships and on your experience of the world.”



“S'il n y a pas de rapport sexuel c'est que l'Autre est d'une autre race.”

“We all act as hinges - fortuitous links between other people.”



“The engineer’s ready capitulation, however, did not hide from the poet’s mother the sad realization that the adventure into which she had plunged so impulsively--and which had seemed so intoxicatingly beautiful--had no turned out to be the great, mutually fulfilling love she was convinced she had a full right to expect. Her father was the owner of two prosperous Prague pharmacies, and her morality was based on strict give-and-take. For her part, she had invested everything in love (she had even been willing to sacrifice her parents and their peaceful existence); in turn, she had expected her partner to invest an equal amount of capital of feelings in the common account. To redress the imbalance, she gradually withdrew her emotional deposit and after the wedding presented a proud, severe face to her husband.”



“The golden rule of business is supply and demand. I venture to say that this is also the rule of happiness. When a balance is achieved between our desires and another's willingness to satisfy them, the result is a sympathetic, mutually rewarding relationship. (...) a thriving economy of love.' - character Mike Lambeth”



“We don’t know when a compatible person will come into our life. We don’t know, for sure, if they will leave or stay. If they leave, we don’t know if they will return. We don’t know if we will always feel the relationship is compatible and if we will want to be there. We don’t really know anything. We can only graciously accept what life brings and all the terror of change that comes with it and then keep moving forward. Life is not static. It doesn’t start nor does it end. It changes form. It is ongoing with highs and lows, successes and crushing failures, experiments, beautiful moments, touching visions, angers, forgiveness, awe, and love.”



“Women always have and always will continue to date a man's potential instead of his reality. We can't help ourselves. It's in a woman's nature to be hopeful and to see the possibilities, the greatness that people possess. Hooray for us; aren't we lovely. We are, but dating someone's potential is probably the biggest mistake women make in relationships and certainly the one that leads to our romantic downfall. That's because there are three types of men: the ones that find our faith in their potential to be appealing, the ones that find our faith in their potential to be a burden...and the ones that find it appealing at first, then are crushed by the burden of their unreached potential and resentful of the women they once adored for that very faith.”



“Poe is missing out on love. Because he's afraid. Afraid to go the distance. Afraid to fully let someone into all the crap we have to live with. I know what it's like to have that fear. But that fear didn't stop the scary shit from happening.”



“Making someone feel obligated, pressured or forced into doing something of a sexual nature that they don't want to is sexual coercion. This includes persistent attempts at sexual contact when the person has already refused you. Nobody owes you sex, ever; and no means no, always.”




“For the first time in my life, I felt the pain of missing people I had not yet left.”



“He didn't take any of my shit. I needed that.”



“It's so weird that adults in committed relationships have a problem with something so innocuous as flirting. I would never expect you to walk around with a paper bag over your head to avoid catching the eye of a stranger, nor would I discourage you making friendly conversation with whomever you might encounter during the day. And if you needed to fuck somebody else, we could talk about it. People change, our desires evolve, and it feels foolish to me to expect what you'll want two, five, or ten years from now will be exactly the same thing that fills you up today. I mean, the way I feel about fidelity has evolved over the last ten years of my life. It's a hard-and-fast rule that we don't apply to any other thing in our lives: YOU MUST LOVE THIS [SHOW/BOOK/FOOD/SHIRT] WITH UNWAVERING FERVOR FOR THE REST OF YOUR NATURAL LIFE. Could you imagine being forced to listen to your favorite record from before your music tastes were refined for the rest of your life? Right now I'm pretty sure I could listen to Midnight Snack by HOMESHAKE for the rest of my life, but me ten years ago was really into acoustic Dave Matthews, and I'm not sure how I feel about that today. And yes, I am oversimplifying it, but really, if in seven years you want to have sex with the proverbial milkman, just let me know about it beforehand so I can hide my LaCroix and half eaten wedge of port salut. ('Milkmen' always eat all the good snacks.)”



“Friendships - and indeed most relationships - are measured in the closeness of hearts,
minds and soul ties... not in the distance of physical miles or even the passing of time.”

“There is a part of us that knows the timing of any relationship. It knows things that we cannot work out. It knows when to say yes. It knows when to say no. It knows when to wait. It knows when something has finished. It knows when something has started. It knows when we have a responsibility to another person. It knows when the ties are untied. It will not betray us or another.”

“Friendship happens when the distance between the hearts tends to zero.”



“Love is supposed to lift you up, not hold you down. It is supposed to push you forward, not hold you back.”



“Through love, tribes have been intermixing colors to reveal a new rainbow world. And as more time passes, this racial and cultural blending will make it harder for humans to side with one race, nation or religion over another.”



“What you reject today, you could accept tomorrow. And what you accept today, you could reject tomorrow. Never say never unless you can predict the future.”



“Love is being able to view a situation without adding duality to it.”



“In the way that you need to clear the way to make a road, those who betray and abandon you expose things you need to remove from your life. They reveal the mistakes you made in trusting them and how you can avoid them in the future, and move on.”



“Your body would not get sick if you held no thought of resentment. It is neither good nor bad of itself. If we hold anything against anyone, we will suffer ourselves.”



“There is the purity of love, harmonious in every way, but not meant for a lifetime, and then there is the steady love of commitment - no less real but completely different. She had both.”

“Baths, she thought, were just like her relationships, all "ooh, ah" in the beginning and then suddenly, without warning, she had to get out, out, out!”



“If there's one person in the world you should be with, there must be one person in the world you shouldn't be with.”



“You see, Katie," Pastor Ron said, "that’s what makes faith so tough to grasp, but also makes it so wonderful. It’s all about believing in something—whether it’s God, or other people, or even yourself—when you’ve got nothing else to go on. Nothing but a little voice inside telling you it’s more than a hunch.”



“To lovers there.
Most ladies the reason they are dumped and their relationship doesn't last is they made themselves to become a want than a need in a relationship.”

“Relationships are valuable no matter who they are between.”



“Intimacy requires accommodation and gentleness at it's core, and does with phrases like "If it bothers you I won't do it," and "Now I understand." And "Thank you for telling me that. I hadn't seen it in that light." And "I appreciate you taking the time to get through my defences. I am sorry I put up such a fight."
You'd be surprised how much power there is in respect, and how much respect comes back, and how much intimacy there is when you empower someone instead of overpower them, and how much more love.”



“I like the disaster of the night sky, stars spilling this way and that as if they were upturned from a glass. I like the way good madness feels. I like the way laughter always spills. That's the word for it. It never just comes, it spills. I like the word 'again'. Again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. I like the quiet sound a coffee cup makes when it's set down on a wooden table. So hushed. So inviting. Like morning light yawning through the window and stretching out onto the kitchen floor. I like the way girls' lips look like they're stained with berries. I like the way morning light breaks like a prism through the empty wine bottles on our dusty apartment floor. Glasses empty except for the midnight hour. I like the way blueberries stain my fingers during the summer. I like the way light hits your eyes and turns it into a color that doesn't exist anywhere else other than in this moment. I want it all. I want the breeze to call my name as it rushes down my street, looking for me. I want to feel grass underneath my bare feet and I want to feel the sun kiss freckles onto my cheeks. I want to hear you yell hello as you make your way towards me, not goodbye as you have to go.
That's just a little bit about me.”



“I was always moved when mean people were suddenly nice to me. It was a weakness that would lead me into some bad relationships later in life.”



“They kissed in the middle of the sidewalk, letting the crowds of people flow around them like water around an island.”



“Even a friendship needs an effort from both sides, how can we expect a relationship to work from the effort of one..!!
It should be a true-hearted commitment from both involve.”



“When you have the power to love, that strength, that courage is infinite; that love is infinite. There is nothing finite about it's presence, for love. never. dies.”

“Finally, Carol said in a tone of hopelessness, "Darling, can I ask you to forgive me?"
The tone hurt Therese more than the question. "I love you, Carol."
"But do you see what it means?”



“I lean against my sister's shoulder. "I thought lightning wasn't supposed to strike in the same place twice."
"Sure it does," Izzy tells me. "But only if you're too dumb to move.”



“Relationships are used by the darkness to keep people revolving around the ego’s demands. For a moment, people see the light of the divine in each other. They run to it and then quickly forget the light they once saw as their fears reclaim their consciousness. Thus begins the ongoing battle to protect one’s own ‘rights’, in case they be forgotten or betrayed. The tally of what is owed is counted, the guilt of perceived wrong doings is cast upon the other, one’s freedom must be paid as the price for ‘love’, and it is only in short periods of peace when all of this is forgotten. Those moments are the precious windows of the Soul.”



“I was dying inside because I couldn't have the one I wanted and crying because he didn't want me and because he wasn't what I needed.
But I was living inside because I had the one I needed and smiling because I was what he wanted and because I was what he needed.
Once you realize that having what you need, is in what wants and needs you, and is where the real love is found, though embedded deeply in the mind body and soul of your other half ....like hidden jewels...precious stones, untrodden roads, hidden pathways, tranquil parks and undiscovered wonders of the world; by which you create bonds through life experiences, whereby the reward is happiness; you realize that you behold the beauty of what love really is.
You then know that you have something preeminent in the palm of your hand. And that revelation, that ephiphamy, is a sign of growth, in that you are ordained to a horizontal equivalent, by virtue of bountifully maturing enough into a quintessential frame of mind, where you have the mental capacity and obligatory wherewithal to handle the authority of love. You've truly arrived to the most profound place, because you now know that you do have what you want- because all we want is to love and to be love.
The substance is never found on the surface. Not the good substance. The only substance that sits in such a shallow place is more than likely something toxic.
The real substance is at the bottom of the sea. That's where the mystery unfolds. The deepest part of your heart is like the deepest part of the ocean, and when someone is brave enough to go there, it's worth sharing the treasures buried deeply within.”



“Can I Tinder swipe for cat cuddles?”



“I love being aroused.
I relish that delicious feeling of freedom, the delirium of being naked, and my flesh being born again.
It’s like I’m being made new.”




“Some women marry houses.”

“If you have time to whine then you have time to find solution.”

“It was the impatience of the way he tore my panties from my body, that really turned me on: I was all he could think of, as his lust got the better of him.
I glanced back, and saw the underwear torn and discarded, a little strip of thin black material on the floor, and thought,
Yes, this is the kind of impatient sex I’m looking for.

The way they looked so small, and cruelly forgotten, was a beautiful symbol of how much we both needed to satisfy our lusts.”



“12% of people marry because they are completely in love. 88% of people marry just so they are then liable for only half of their rent.”

“In some ways, we will always be different. In other ways, we will always be the same. There is always room to disagree and blame, just as there is always room to take a new perspective and empathize. Understanding is a choice.”

“Sometimes we can focus so much on nothing that we make it a big something of nothing”



“Loving you was like jumping into the dark side of a pool, and drowning.”

“Nakajima’s past would always be there, so the foundation could crumble at any moment. That’s what happens, I realized, when people destroy other people.”



“Being single is definitely better than being with the wrong person”

“Adversity is a mirage. People, situations, and relationships sometimes change for the worst but inevitably clear a path for far better replacements. The continued journey will always find bliss.”

“If a boy doesn't respect his mother...run!”



“If you have nothing in common with the person you are dating and his parents hate you and your friends hate him, this is not romantic; it's a bad idea.”



“It is not always a problem finding the truth, it is however sometimes a problem accepting it.”

“I am a diamond in the rut. A diamond to an untrained eye looks like a rock stone. So men will kick it around on the ground. It takes a man with an expert eye for fine Jewelry to notice its worth. Do not feel bad when men treat you like the little boys in Africa who gave away stones in exchange for candy. The hungry boys thought they were getting something better but had exchange wealth for a sugar high. Some men will do that. Exchange a valuable woman for the transient high of another. The boys didn't know better and so do some of these men. They don't know your worth.”



“Strangers will show you the way
But a true friend will escort you,
to your destination.
1st November, 2006”

“There's this total manwhore phenomenon happening, where even the geeks are player now. It's like Manhattan is this giant playground and guys want to keep playing forever.”



“I don't know what to say to fill the silence. I don't know how to fix this. It seems wrong to leave him, but I have to. There's no compromise, no alternative. Things just weren't meant to be, which seems like a pansy-ass thing to say, until it happens to you.”



“Different people have different ways of defining, living and maintaining relationships. Your way is not the only right way, it is merely your way. As far as right way is concerned, there isn't any. It is all about different opinions and perceptions.”

“I had a dream about you. You were wearing Sylvester Stallone's sneer as pants, but his lips were saggy on your legs, so you had to wear a mustache as a belt. ”



“My brother, Langston, said, “Lily, you don’t understand because you’ve never been in love. If you had a boyfriend, you’d understand.” Langston has a new boyfriend and all I understand from that is a sorry state of co-dependence.”



“Accept that what you see is what you'll get. Once your relationship becomes firmly established, your partner's personality and the way in which [he or] she treats you will most likely be what your future together will look like. Staying with a partner whom you hope will change usually results in disappointment.”



“But even so, I wondered--how well do we really ever know someone?”



“I had a dream about you. We were ice fishing in my freezer. I caught a few cold beers, and you wondered if we should drink them, or throw them back because they were babies. ”



“In a sudden and soundless eruption, as if he has fallen into a waking dream, a stream of images pours down, images of women he has known on two continents, some from so far away in time that he barely recognizes them. Like leaves blown on the wind, pell-mell, they pass before him. A fair field full of folk: hundreds of lives all tangled with his. He holds his breath, willing the vision to continue.
What has happened to them, all those women, all those lives? Are there moments when they too, or some of them, are plunged without warning into the ocean of memory? The German girl: is it possible that at this very instant she is remembering the man who picked her up on the roadside in Africa and spent the night with her?
Enriched: that was the word the newspapers picked on to jeer at. A stupid word to let slip, under the circumstances, yet now, at this moment, he would stand by it. By Melanie, by the girl in Touws River; by Rosalind, Bev Shaw, Soraya: by each of them he was enriched, and by the others too, even the least of them, even the failures. Like a flower blooming in his breast, his heart floods with thankfulness.”



“I fell in love with him. But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available. I stay with him because I choose to everyday that I wake up, everyday that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.”



“Relationships should be like glass .... No matter who sees from what angel .... It should be transparent”

“I had a dream about you. You looked like you, but you also looked like a mannequin. And I looked like me, but I also looked like a mannequin. Between the two of us, we were too fake even for Hollywood. And as such, we were forced to reside in Washington DC. ”



“I also have no idea how to be a girlfriend. I love sleeping alone and I avoid sick people at all costs. I don't even cook for myself, so I need someone who appreciates a lovingly baked frozen pizza.”



“You know what she's made of."
"Yeah, good stock, good breeding, a hard head and a hunger to win." She flashed him a smile as they approached the kitchen door. "I've been told that describes me. I'm half Irish, Brian, I was born stubborn."
"No arguing with that. A person might make the world a calmer place for others by being passive, but you don't get very far in it yourself, do you?"
"Look at that. We have a foundation of agreement. Now tell me you like spaghetti and meatballs."
"It happens to be a favorite of mine."
"That's handy. Mine, too. And I heard a rumor that's what's for dinner." She reached for the doorknob, then caught him off guard by brushing a light kiss over his lips. "And since we'll be joining my parents, it would probably be best if you didn't imagine me naked for the next couple of hours."
She sailed in ahead of him, leaving Brian helplessly and utterly aroused.”



“You have to be quite heavily invested in someone to do them the honour of telling them you're annoyed with them.”

“... the best way of killing a rose is to force it open when it is still only the promise of a bud.”




“Give her the continent and she wanted the hemisphere.”



“Something snapped inside her. “Of course I’m afraid! Relationships do bad things to me.” He started to respond, but the pain had gone on long enough, and she didn’t want to hear it. “You know what I want? I want peace. I want a good job and a decent place to live. I want to read books and listen to music and have time to make some female friendships that are going to last. When I wake up in the morning, I want to know that I have a decent shot at being happy. And here’s what’s really sad. Until I met you, I was almost there.”



“Tenderness emerges from the fact that the two persons, longing, as all individuals do, to overcome the separateness and isolation to which we are all heir because we are individuals, can participate in a relationship that, for the moment, is not of two isolated selves but a union”

“The best foundation for relationships to grow, flourish, and succeed is a deep-rooted friendship.”



“A certain amount of volatility and drama can me healthy and keep things fun and interesting if you're willing at any moment during a fight to say, 'This means nothing. I love you, let's forget about it.”



“This is the list you carry in your pocket, of the things you plan to say to Kay, when you find him, if you find him:
1. I’m sorry that I forgot to water your ferns while you were away that time.
2. When you said that I reminded you of your mother, was that a good thing?
3. I never really liked your friends all that much.
4. None of my friends ever really liked you.
5. Do you remember when the cat ran away, and I cried and cried and made you put up posters, and she never came back? I wasn’t crying because she didn’t come back. I was crying because I’d taken her to the woods, and I was scared she’d come back and tell you what I’d done, but I guess a wolf got her, or something. She never liked me anyway.
6. I never liked your mother.
7. After you left, I didn’t water your plants on purpose. They’re all dead.
8. Goodbye.
9. Were you ever really in love with me?
10. Was I good in bed, or just average?
11. What exactly did you mean, when you said that it was fine that I had put on a little weight, that you thought I was even more beautiful, that I should go ahead and eat as much as I wanted, but when I weighed myself on the bathroom scale, I was exactly the same weight as before, I hadn’t gained a single pound?
12. So all those times, I’m being honest here, every single time, and anyway I don’t care if you don’t believe me, I faked every orgasm you ever thought I had. Women can do that, you know. You never made me come, not even once.
13. So maybe I’m an idiot, but I used to be in love with you.
14. I slept with some guy, I didn’t mean to, it just kind of happened. Is that how it was with you? Not that I’m making any apologies, or that I’d accept yours, I just want to know.
15. My feet hurt, and it’s all your fault.
16. I mean it this time, goodbye.”



“Even "meant to be" takes work.”

“Being honest in a relationship is at times exceedingly difficult and painful. Yet the moment a person evades the truth, central fibers of the self pull away and the person initiates a process of deception - a way of manipulating the other person by preventing the person from discovering "real thoughts and real feelings”

“Definition of a relationship - an enduring, mutually-agreed upon connection or union, which fulfills certain needs of the individuals involved and the society in which they live.”



“Love will never let you down, if you don't give it up”

“What happened was this: I got an image in my head that never got out. We see a great many things and can remember a great many things, but that is different. We get very few of the true images in our heads of the kind I am talking about, the kind that become more and more vivid for us as if the passage of the years did not obscure their reality but, year by year, drew off another veil to expose a meaning which we had only dimly surmised at first. Very probably the last veil will not be removed, for there are not enough years, but the brightness of the image increases and our conviction increases that the brightness is meaning, or the legend of meaning, and without the image our lives would be nothing except an old piece of film rolled on a spool and thrown into a desk drawer among the unanswered letters.”



“I shall now explain my plan. You may then speak, but only to amend the detail. The broad outline is not subject to negotiation. Are you ready? Good … I propose to have sex with you. I believe it will be excellent sex. Your obedience on one particular issue of timing it will be required to make it unforgettable sex. I will explain that issue as we go. At the moment, I wish to hear your inevitable objection to the general sex part of this plan.”



“How we perceive, feel about and respond to people and situations is far more guided by the lessons of early childhood than we would like to believe. We may be adults, chronologically and physically, but too often the youngest parts of our personality are invisibly, yet actively, living our lives.”



“A relationship could be a place to hide too.”



“did you ever think the reason you haven't found the right man is because it's not your time? Sometimes God kets bad things happen to us as a sign that something is not right. He also does it to make us stronger. God got a plan for you, and you gotta stop fighting it. Focus on YOU, and let God lead that man to you.”



“One of the most astounding dynamics in human relationships is how the unconscious intuition of our brain's right hemisphere is able to act as radar to find us just the right person to provoke and recreate our childhood attachment relationship ...I've given much thought to the question of why we are designed to be drawn -like a moth to a flame- to the very person who is most likely to resurrect all our childhood anguish. It seems like a cruel hoax to play on two wounded souls.”



“Whether our caretaker was our mom, dad, uncle, aunt, grandparent, foster parent, or sibling, our blueprint of what a relationship is supposed to look like is drafted by what we observed from our caretaker’s relationship. If our caretaker took their significant other back multiple times, made excuses for their actions, helped them battle demons, turned a blind eye to their infidelity, or moved from one relationship to the next, that is what we know. Their behavior becomes our very own model of what a relationship is supposed to look like and determines what we will expect from our own partners.﻿”



“I read once that sorrow looks back, worry looks around, and faith looks ahead.”



“When you think of it, people may rub elbows and still have an ocean or two between them.”



“In a culture of diversity, one group is likely not "just like everyone else." To deny that we have different needs, concerns, thought processes, worldview, is to refuse to look at the reason we are supposedly an identifiable community.”



“It is possible to compromise in certain areas when choosing a partner for life, but never on a cravat.”



“It's one thing to say you think someone "hung the moon" but that generally means you are blind and deluded, and then the relationship fails because they say you changed, when really, they never saw you at all...The real test is if someone sees all your flaws or blemishes or individual differences, and they still think you hung the moon.”

“We've come a long way from the time when the crowning achievement in a woman's life was her youthful marriage. And many would agree that this represents progress for women. But when did the search for someone to marry become self-absorbed and pathetic? This absence of social sympathy for women's ambitions to marry is all the more striking because the social world has cared so deeply about virtually every other aspect of these privileged young women's inner and outer lives. (...) The achievement of a good marriage is the one area of life where the most privileged, accomplished, and high achieving young women in society face a loss of support and sympathy for their ambitions and where the social expectations are for disappointment and failure, not success.”



“I know how bad you boys feel, but the sun will still come up tomorrow. And when it does, you 'll feel better. When the sun comes up the day after tomorrow, a little better still. This is just a part of your life, and it's over. It would have been better to win, but either way, it's over. Life will go on.”

“All I know is that the closer I get to God, the deeper I get into the Bible, and the heavier the burden seems on my shoulders.”



“When it comes to relationships, I find it best to have two feet out the door”

“males conspicuously leaving their mark to let others know where they weren't welcome.”



“Could it possibly be that he yearned for some of the same things she yearned for? Love. Someone to call your own. Someone to share the joys and the sorrows of life.”



“We men are fascinated by the things we don't really understand. It gives us something to think and talk about: like females, they drive us nuts.”




“I think it's the same with all the relationships between a man and a woman. They can survive anything so long as some kind of basic humanity exists between the two people. When all kindness has gone, when one person obviously and sincerely doesn't care if the other is alive or dead, then it's just no good.
-- from Quantum of Solace”



“schools for love do not exist. everyone assumes that we will know how to love instinctively.
despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, we still accept that the family is the primary school for love.
those of us who do not learn how to love among family are expected to experience love in romantic relationships. however this love often eludes us.”



“LADY BRACKNELL
To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.”



“Conflict can and should be handled constructively; when it is, relationships benefit. Conflict avoidance is *not* the hallmark of a good relationship. On the contrary, it is a symptom of serious problems and of poor communication.”



“Because of that she had never had enough energy to be herself, a person who, like everyone else in the world, needed other people in order to be happy. But other people were so difficult. They reacted in unpredictable ways, they surrounded themselves with defensive walls, they behaved just as she did, pretending they didn't care about anything. When someone more open to life appeared, they either rejected them outright or made them suffer, consigning them to being inferior, ingenuous.”



“A rewarding relationship occurs when there is a common spiritual goal, shared spiritual values and a mutual desire to build a relationship upon a spiritual foundation and for the purpose of connecting to the light of the creator.”



“And you? Now that I have discovered you? Beautiful, dangerous, unleashed. Still I try to hold you, knowing that your body is faced with knives.”



“Because, Jack, you volunteered to be taken down into eternal torment in place of her. This is the absolute
minimum
(unless I'm mistaken) that any female requires from her man.”



“Life, weddings, relationships, road trips, gardening, making out, haircuts: few of the fun things in life always go as expected.”



“If I loved someone, I could never let him go away from me. I would be too miserable and lonely.”

“Why are poets so apt to choose their mates, not for any similarity of poetic endowment, but for qualities which might make the happiness of the rudest handicraftsman as well as that of the ideal craftsman of the spirit? Because, probably, at his highest elevation, the poet needs no human intercourse; but he finds it dreary to descend, and be a stranger.”



“Once," Fran says, settling against the worktable, folding her arms, "I knew this kid who very bravely and bossily came out of the closet when she was only fourteen years old. She told me then that we can't choose who we love. We just love the people we love, no mattter what anyone else might want for us. Wasn't that you?”



“Was Deirdre right about me purposely wanting relationships that were impossible?”



“I wouldn't have cared if my girlfriend was a Jaguar-driving Cyclops with a beard - I'd have been grateful just to have someone to make out with.”



“Honor your relationships by developing listening skills.”



“Polyamorous people are wary of having others' values inflicted upon themselves, and so tend to stay very far away from making such pronouncements, to the point that they will actively ignore predatory behavior that is affecting their own "community.”



“In our relationship, we have very well-defined roles: I am the Vice President of Logistics; he's the CEO of Emotional Support.”



“Okay, then, what was he like? Just give me something to go on so that I have a shot at him!'
'A shot at him? Are you on an elk hunt?”



“Hope is putting Faith "on the line" and expecting results!

“The heart of a person only beats when it's surrounded by blood, by family.”



“I slid down in the seat and began to weep. I wept for her, for me, but mostly because the siren call of my first big story with a yellow border around it was more powerful than the call of fatherhood.”



“Naturally, I do blame Françoise. I blame her for having N in the first place. She was young, she was beautiful, she was married to a doctor, and she was intelligent. She could have abstained from producing her first son. It was wrong on a variety of levels.”



“In advising the heads of state to learn from tragedy rather than perpetuate its existence Robert Kennedy excalimed, "Tragedy is a tool for the living to gain wisdom, not a guide by which to live." We have a tendency to dwell on tragedy and use it as a justification for tragic occurrences that follow,rather than parse the tragedy, taking from it important lessons and using those lessons to avoid similar tragedies.”

“Relationships are physics. Time transforms things- it has to, because the change from me to we means clearing away the fortifications you'r put up around your old personality. Living with Susannah made me feel as if I started riding Einstein's famous theoretical bus. Here's my understanding of that difficult idea, nutshelled: if you're riding a magic Greyhound, equipped for light-speed travel, you'll actually live though less time than will any pedestrians whom the bus passes by. So, for a neighbor on the street with a stopwatch, the superfast bus will take two hours to travel from Point A to Point B. But where you're on that Greyhound, and looking at the wipe of the world out those rhomboidial coach windows, the same trip will take just under twenty-four minutes. Your neighbor, stopwatch under thumb, will have aged eighty-six percent more than you have. It's hard to fathom. But I think it's exactly what adult relationships do to us: on the outside, years pass, lives change. But inside, it's just a day that repeats. You and your partner age at the same clip; it seems not time has gone by. Only when you look up from your relationship- when you step off the bus, feel the ground under your shoes- do you sense the sly, soft absurdity of romance physics.”



“Although I notice there is never a truly good time to have a nice long chat with one´s mother-in-law, unless you are having an extraordinary life and marriage and your mother-in-law is, say, Maureen Dowd, or Indira Gandhi. Someone of that ilk.”



“Cáel sighed. “Look, right now? Either you want Rose, or you don’t. If you do—and, quite frankly, it’s obvious to me that you do—then give the woman a break and give yourself some credit for not being a whack job. Women are strange creatures, Gray, and she isn’t a mind reader. Who the hell knows what kind of conclusions she’s drawn over your behavior? Shit or get off the pot.”
It was a good thing Gray wasn’t drinking anything, or he’d have choked on that one. “
That’s
your advice on love? ‘Shit or get off the pot’?”



“Très, très, triste...”



“They're horrible little creatures. All snot and smelly feet and pestering questions."
"Then why did you go into teaching?"
"It was either that or sit at home with Mother all day. I picked the lesser of two evils.”



“When I meet a woman whose energy falters at the first barrier,she seems to fade beside my mother.”

“Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end, an end which it was already but too easy to arrive at; as railroads lead to Boston or New York. We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate.”




“You can know a thing to death and be for all purposes completely ignorant of it. A man can know his father, or his son, and there might still be nothing between them but loyalty and love and mutual incomprehension.”



“Some cynical Frenchman has said that there are two parties to a love-transaction: the one who loves and the other who condescends to be so treated.”



“They say you are not you except in terms of relation to other people. If there weren't any other people there wouldn't be any you because what you do, which is what you are, only has meaning in relation to other people.”



“Après trois ans, un couple doit se quitter, se suicider, ou faire des enfants, ce qui sont trois façons d'entériner sa fin.”



“Because that’s intimacy, Buckaroos.
Somebody who understands exactly how weird you are, and you understand exactly how weird they are, and you’re in a sort of mutually beneficial hostage situation.”



“The trouble is, I can't find a part of myself where you're not important. I write in order to be worth your while and to finance the way I want to live with you. Not the way you want to live. The way I want to live with you. Without you I wouldn't care. I'd eat tinned spaghetti and put on yesterday's clothes. But as it is I change my socks, and make money, and tart up Brodie's unspeakable drivel into speakable drivel so he can be an author too, like me.”



“Many aspects of our screen-bound lives are bad for our social skills simply because we get accustomed to controlling the information that comes in, managing our relationships electronically, deleting stuff that doesn't interest us. We edit the world; we select from menus; we pick and choose; our social 'group' focuses on us and disintegrates without us. This makes it rather confusing for us when we step outdoors and discover that other people's behaviour can't be deleted with a simple one-stroke command or dragged to the trash icon.”



“While the primary function of formal Buddhist meditation is to create the possibility of the experience of "being," my work as a therapist has shown me that the demands of intimate life can be just as useful as meditation in moving people toward this capacity. Just as in formal meditation, intimate relationships teach us that the more we relate to each other as objects, the greater our disappointment. The trick, as in meditation, is to use this disappointment to change the way we relate.”



“Błogosławiony ten, co nie mając nic do powiedzenia, nie obleka tego faktu w słowa.”

“...I try to incorporate life's lessons from everyone around me and pay it forward anytime I can. I look at every person I meet as a new and thrilling experience with which I'm gifted. Every new city or country or continent that I visit is a beautiful exploration from which I can learn. Every new client or project represents the possibility of meeting new people and having new adventures.”

“Suddenly the thought that the end of her life was imminent shocked him; it was one thing to pity someone he didn't know, quite another to face the same dilemma with someone he knew intimately. That was the trouble with beds. They turned strangers into intimates more quickly than ten years of polite teas in parlours.”



“We have to live like people in a web of knives, we mustn't reach out our hands or we get them gashed.”



“More than anything I wish he were here with me. "A relationship is an accumulation of shared history," he'd said to me once. And here I was making history without him. It's lonely. And I can't wait to go home. Parts of me are showing through my Aqua, and I'm having a hard time keeping them separate.”



“In the world I lived in, the world of human people, there were ties and debts and consequences and good deeds. That was what bound people to society; maybe that was what constituted society. And I tried to live in my little niche in it the best way I could.”



“I am sorry the only outlet for her troubled mind was in clumsy foreplay with an inadequate partner."
He threw the rest of her sandwich at the swinging door as she passed through it.”



“How do I feel today? I feel as unfit as an unfiddle,
And it is the result of a certain turbulence in the mind and an uncertain burbulence in the middle.
What was it, anyway, that angry thing that flew at me?
I am unused to banshees crying Boo at me.
Your wife can’t be a banshee—
Or can she?”



“You have made him live.”



“I have produced no children of my own and my husband is dead," she replied, an acid tone in her voice. "Thus I am more to be pitied than revered. I am expected to give up the shop to my nephew, who will then be able to afford to bring a very good wife from Pakistan. In exchange, I will be given houseroom and no doubt, the honor of taking care of several small children of other family members."
The Major was silent. He was at once appalled and also reluctant to hear any more. This was why people usually talked about the weather.”



“There was no singles problem until singles got so single-minded that they stopped wasting time with anyone ineligible. Before that, it was understood that one of society's main tasks was matchmaking. People with lifelong friendships and ties to local nonprofessional organizations did not have to fear that isolation would accompany retirement, old age, or losing a spouse. Overburdened householders could count on the assistance not only of their own extended families, but of the American tradition of neighborliness.”



“Maybe he was old-fashioned, but to him a couple meant a strong bond, with positive and negative charges constantly arcing between them.”



“I had an absurd desire to go down to her and make sure she was all right, and stay with her until dawn. I also had a fierce wish to bludgeon the two frat boys to death with a shovel.”



“My Miracle, living through a Traumatic brain Injury”

“Can I have a glass of water?" Her voice was hoarse, probably from screaming. She'd always sounded like that after they'd-
He didn't just force the thought aside. He clubbed it unconscious, threw it into a crawl space and walled it up alive.”



“She wrote a long letter on a short piece of paper”

“In the long history of male and female relations all the way back to the Garden, I can't think of one in which a woman's anger ever won over a man.”



“Even now, he is every blue blazer getting into cab, every runner along the river,every motorcycle coming and going.”



“I write with the entire alphabet, not just the popular letters.
Readers don't want to lose themselves in the text. They want to find themselves in it.”



“On se réconcilie avec un ennemi qui nous est inférieur pour les qualités du coeur ou de l'esprit ; on ne pardonne jamais à celui qui nous surpasse par l'âme et le génie.”

“Each store will fulfil some of your needs, but no individual store can meet all of your needs. Learning how to set realistic expectations now and in future relationships requires you to examine each of the existing stores to see what they can offer.”

“Be honest. This applies to every area of your life. Sketchiness is not an attractive trait. No more trying to cover up your baggage, sweeping things under the rug, withholding truth, blatant lying, or even telling seemingly ‘harmless’ white lies or half-truths – release the need to lie completely! Start NOW.”




“You’re my princess, right? You were always going to be my princess, no matter what you were born, no matter who your dad married.”



“When in the presence of someone with whom you have a bond, and to whom you have entrusted your feelings, it is hard to lie and get away with it. The truth just wants to come flowing out. This is especially the case when you are trying to hide your sadness or vulnerability. It is much easier to conceal sadness from a stranger, or from someone you don't trust.”



“You know, when you come to think about it, it's a wonder women have anything to do with men at all, and no surprise that men have devised all kinds of schemes to bind women to them, like not giving them any money. If you had your choice of sleeping with a beautiful soft creature or a large hard one, which would you pick? I mean, if they both had the same amount of money?”



“More than friends, eh? More than friends... You know, my mother once told me that half of the hatred that springs up between people is rooted in this mistaken belief that there's any human relationship more sacred than friendship.”



“We have already said more goodbyes than are necessary. Those were goodbyes that brought about the end of partings. We taught each other that no parting is possible.”



“We draw into our life those who will help us to grow. Naturally, we tend to have mixed feelings about those very people but they are marked for us. We have forgotten that we wrote them an invitation some time ago. We look at them as if they are intruders when all along they are our guests.”



“Relationships are about taking off the mask you wear to make someone like you and letting them see the real you. The one you hid all the time. The one you never thought was good enough to find love in the first place.”



“You can turn every ugly and damaging drama into a genuine blessing by seeing it differently. No one is suffering on purpose. We learn to give up the pleasure we feel in self-righteously blaming others. Healing happens when we see things differently. The question is: do you want suffering or peace? It's that simple.”



“...it is not always possible to restore one’s boundaries after they have been blurred and made permeable by a relationship: try as we might, we cannot reconstitute ourselves as the autonomous beings we previously imagined ourselves to be. Something of us is now outside, and something of the outside is now within us.”



“Find yourself first, and be surprised at how quickly and logically “the” one just appears in front of you.”



“I know the you who’s in the margins. I know you’re thinking hard about what you want and why– more than some people ever do. I know you can take on a challenge and kick its ass. And I know you’ve tried harder to understand me than anyone has in a long time.”



“We make people special to us, believing that they can save us. When one thing doesn’t work, we look somewhere else to be saved. We rarely question the concept, itself. Sometimes, we don’t look to another person to save us but to money, acknowledgement, a title, a cause, a notion of ourselves. None of it can save us. We travel the path in different ways; some are polite, some are ruthless, some are clever, some are instinctive. In the end, it all leads to the same despairing place. In the unsuspecting quiet moments, there it is; a sense of peace and a feeling that everything is fine without searching for anything to be saved by.”



“We are aware that blaming and arguing can never help us and only create a wider gap between us; that only understanding, trust, and love can help us change and grow”



“If one million of you give assent to the one thousand who participate in the murder of a child, then one million of you are a million times guilty.”

“Cultivating loving kindness for ourselves is the foundation of real love for our friends and family, for new people we encounter in our daily lives, for all beings and for life itself.”



“When you feel the emotional reaction of someone's supposed [verbal] attack, what you're doing is getting them to reflect to you that some portion of yourself feels that way about yourself. Otherwise you wouldn't react. You would just observe it - "oh interesting." - and move on with your day. But if you react to it, it's showing you some part of you actually is buying into this as true.
So say: "Well thank you: Thank you for showing that i was not loving all of myself."
And when you really start doing that, then you may start to see that someone else's attitude toward you may change.”

“No crime is a means to an end. No crime can be rationalized.”

“In addition to my new outlook on life, in some absurdly simple way, Anissa gave me several new reasons to live. Above all, I had to see her again and find out what, if anything, would happen between her and me.”



“There is a depth to life which only comes from our connection to other people. However, we have to find it without becoming a prisoner.”



“She: So where do we go from here?
He: Nowhere!
She: What do you mean?
He: You go your way and I go mine!
She: Can we have a future together?
He: I don't settle down! I am the wanderer and wandering is my destiny!”

“One thing he says: If you could be an emotion, it would be spite.
One thing I say: If you could be an animal, it would be a sloth.
But I only say that out of spite.”



“They keep texting you wyd and wya — instead of how you feeling — what’s on your mind — and you wonder why you feel misunderstood”

“The purpose of a relationship is to reflect to all the others in the relationship what they need to understand to become more of themselves.
Everyone in a relationship is in a relationship for the purpose of helping the other people in the relationship, giving them opportunities to learn to be who they are more and more.”

“Every grievance you hold hides a little more of the light of the world from your eyes until the darkness becomes overwhelming. Everything you forgive restores that light. So ask yourself, who is it that you are really hurting?”



“When restless sexual desire arises, we pay attention to it with enough understanding and enough love that it dissipates and does not grow.”



“Soul Mates share complementary, compatible life goals and their spiritual natures are often in sync with ours. They also experience an immense level of comfort with each other that cannot be experienced in other relationships, and they complement each other in many ways through their strengths and weaknesses.”



“My need to show what I can do is keeping me from finding out what other people can do and what we can do together.”

“Oftentimes someone leaves their partner who is comparable to the sun for someone else who is comparable to a spark.”

“No, we don't accomplish our love in a single year
as the flowers do; an immemorial sap
flows up through our arms when we love.
(Siehe, wir lieben nicht, wie die Blumen, aus einem
einzigen Jahr; uns steigt, wo wir lieben,
unvordenklicher Saft in die Arme.)”

“Your comfort zone is a place where you keep yourself in a self-illusion and nothing can grow there but your potentiality can grow only when you can think and grow out of that zone.”

“It's ok to be a fool once or twice but never let it be a third time. Be smart and pretend to be a fool and at the end of the hunt make sure you're the one that has the gun.”

“It's hard to experience desire when you're weighted down by concern.”




“I hope you read this, whoever you are, and imagine that there is a hypothetical person out there who needs your love, has been waiting silently, patiently for it all his life, is flawed and downright ugly at times and yet would have just eaten up any tiny bit of affection you had been willing to give, had you ever stopped your own happy life to notice. And then imagine that this hypothetical person is real, because he probably is.... Wish I’d met you. Wish I wasn’t your hypothetical. But you’re reading this, which means a few minutes ago, I went into that bathroom and pulled the trigger. You probably heard it. Sorry. You’re welcome. Thank you. And please. Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.”



“There are moments in relationship when you didn't speak, you didn't have to; but you talked a lot.”



“Claiming to love self, but willingly default to cheating at the first sign of trouble is nothing short of playing yourself. Your ego may feel avenged - temporarily - but your heart and soul, the true self, will suffer the long term affects of karma's justifiable sting.”



“I am not looking for a "perfect" man. Only one who matches me on an emotional, spiritual, sexual, and intellectual level.”



“If you stand right at the edge of the night sky, some place where one o’clock leaves to meet two, the breeze will carry your words up to the stars. And they’ll swallow your secrets until its time to hand them over to the truths in the sky- the ones that draw maps in the black.
They carve their answers into the backs of my hands, the grooves of the words running deep in my palms.”



“Doing something later is not automatically the same as doing something better”



“And me, standing under the splintered night,
catching fractured glimpses into the black behind the black,
hearing the prayers of stars, the angry whispers of the dark summer night.
Its voice cracks,
on your name.
My eyes close,
on your name.”



“All men are born firstly with the instinct to protect themselves. But few grow to really love themselves, and even fewer learn to love their neighbor as themselves.”



“If you behave in a manner that poisons your relationship, don’t be surprised when it dies.”

“Sometimes we place faith in the wrong people for the right reasons. We're too blind to their faults, and they're too blind to appreciate us.
—Brighton Hayes”



“One thing I have come to realize is that love is not always happiness.”

“Being in a relationship with some people is like pushing a boat through sand. I used to have the time and energy for that kind of nonsense, but not anymore. Relationships should be a wonderful journey of exploration and love; not grinding resistance.”

“You know what I love? The spaces between I love you. The tap of your fork against the plate and how my cup of wine clicks against our table. The scratchy voice coming from the radio in the other room. The quiet sound of your hand reaching across the table and whispering over mine. How your voice sounds like your mouth on the back of my neck. The soft murmur of our easy conversation.
Between these quiet Tuesday night routines, following every comma and right after every pause for breath, is I, love, and you. In the middle of every I love you is a sink full of dishes, whisper of socked feet tangled in white sheets, and gentle kisses against curved cheeks. We lyric ourselves into the laundry that needs to be finished, into the ends of every smile that follows me repeating your name. We write ourselves into the grocery bags we need to carry, the cracks running up our rented walls, the sides of the bed we choose to drag up the sails of heavy eyed dreams.
Like the spaces between our fingers, in the spaces between I, love, and you, we wait.
The in-betweens have always been my favorite.”



“The idea that we can be exactly what the other desires is a powerful fantasy.”



“I spent half my childhood trying to be like my dad. True for most boys, I think. It turns with adolescence. The last thing I wanted was to be like my dad. It took becoming a man to realize how lucky I’d been. It took a few hard knocks in life to make me realize the only thing my dad had ever wanted or worked for was to give me a chance at being better than him.”



“It's the in-between, the sustenance, not just the gears and bolts that make a human. When you forget to find out how the person was built—the oil, chemistry, and the craft—you miss all the beauty.”



“Fine! He is being passive aggressive with me, and it's gonna backfire; I'm gonna be active friendly.”



“More than nakedness,
for there is no cover to take.
The fire in your eyes
is ringed with water; wide and cool.
We are far from the brutal place,
but you do not think so.
You take my hand
and disappear like you were never there,
except that I am now somewhere else.”



“You want my advice? Put down your phone. Hug her from behind and kiss the back of her neck. Entwine your fingers with hers…. You’re welcome.”

“I want to tell [him] everything - everything that has ever happened to me, every observation I have ever had, and I want to share every book, song, or movie I have ever loved”



“Tell them there are no holes for your fingers in the masks of
men. Tell them how could you ever even hope to love what you can't
grab onto.”



“But when people understand one another without speaking, it can often leave them with very little to talk about, don’t you think?”



“If one thousand of you participate in the murder of one child, then one thousand of you are a thousand times guilty.”

“The greater part of a men who speak ill of women are speaking of a certain woman.”



“We hurt one another. We go through life dressing up in new clothes and covering up our true motives. We meet up lightly, we drink rosé wine, and then we give each other pain. We don't want to! What we want to do, what one really wants to do is put out one's hands—like some dancer, in a trance, just put out one's hands—and touch all the people and tell them: I'm sorry. I love you. Thank you for your e-mail. Thank you for coming to see me. Thank you. But we can't. We can't. On the little life raft of Mark only one other person could fit. Just one! And so, thwarted, we inflict pain. That’s what we do. We do not keep each other company. We do not send each other cute text messages. Or, rather, when we do these things, we do them merely to postpone the moment when we'll push these people off, and beat forward, beat forward on our little raft, alone.”



“If love isn't there, nothing will grow. If it is, there is always hope and it will win in the end. Love is vital and sacrosanct.”

“She wished she were not so aware of the vast gulf between what the men in her life thought she was worth and her actual value. She had, it seemed to her, always asked and expected too much and given too little. She seemed almost to have a perverse impulse to make anyone who cared about her regret it, to find the thing that would most appall those people and then do that until they had to run away as a matter of self-preservation.”



“I'm tired of being inside my head. I want to live out here, with you.”




“When we do the hard, intimate work of friendship, we bring a little more of the divine into daily life.”



“You will say good-bye for all the right reasons. You're tired of living in wait for his apocalypse. You have your own fight on your hands, and though it's no bigger or more noble than his, it will require all of your energy.
It's you who has to hold on to earth. You have to tighten your grip -- which means letting go of him.”



“One as deformed and horrible as myself, could not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species, and have the same defects... with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being...”



“It is harder, usually, to find a person who wants to walk the streets of me, to taste the teas of my country, to... immigrate, you could say.”



“... relationships required such vigilance, such attention. You had to hold them together by force of will, and other people took up so much space, demanded so much time. It was exhausting.”



“I'm always looking for what will make me whole. What will make me happy? Somewhere along the way I started to think it wasn't Helen anymore. She hasn't changed. Her laugh is still the one I remember. Her finger is still the one I put the ring on all those years ago. I can't understand why I don't want to curve next to her, keep her back warm anymore. Surely you don't lose love like keys?”



“People change us. It is a rare, if not an impossible occurrence, that we come out of relationships unscathed. In our dealings with people we take something with us and we leave something behind. Some people are haunted more than others, either by the sweet perfume of another or the stink of regret.”

“...it is never safe to classify the souls of one's neighbors; one is apt, in the long run, to be proved a fool. You should regard each meeting with a friend as a sitting he is unwillingly giving you for a portrait -- a portrait that, probably, when you or he die, will still be unfinished. And, though this is an absorbing pursuit, nevertheless, the painters are apt to end pessimists. For however handsome and merry may be the face, however rich the background, in the first rough sketch of each portrait, yet with every added stroke of the brush, with every tiny readjustment of the 'values,' with every modification of the chiaroscuro, the eyes looking out at you grow more disquieting. And, finally, it is your
own
face that you are staring at in terror, as in a mirror by candle-light, when all the house is still.”



“Build me up and I with you. For we are more one than two.”

“I knew her so well that I loved her, or maybe I loved her so well that I knew her. I didn't want to fight her anymore. I wanted to quit. I wanted to go home. So I blew up her planet.”



“Men, being accustomed to act on reflection themselves, are a great deal too apt to believe that women act on reflection, too. Women do nothing of the sort. They act on impulse; and, in nine cases out of ten, they are heartily sorry for it afterward.”



“Time grants a unique perspective which allows us to see events through a filter of accumulated wisdom.”

“That’s the thing about love
It can take you up to the mountaintop and can drop you
And the impact will either kill you or make you a new person”



“For the life of me I cannot remember, what made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise. For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen.”

“I never told her the other story, in which she stars, in which she is always the heroine – a romanticized story full of cliché images in which I am telling her all the things there has not been enough time for, in which we are doing all the things there has not been time for…”



“They shared a laugh, and then the silence that so often intruded on their discussion asserted itself once again, a gap born of equal parts weariness, familiarity and--conversely--the many differences that fate had created between those who had once gone about lives that were but variations on a single melody.”



“If one does not make an ego out of gender, one would still know whether one is a man or a woman, gay, straight, bisexual, transgender—whatever else we may think of. But those identities need to fit very loosely and be worn very lightly. All sense of privilege or deprivation that has developed around one’s gender identity, all rigidity regarding proper roles and behaviors for the various genders, must be cut through.”

“There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.”



“I had a dream about you. At first you were a mannequin, and I was a fashion designer. Then, inexplicably, we switched roles and I became the mannequin. But instead of putting clothes on me, you laughed at my nakedness, and you sold me to the owner of a sex shop.  ”



“I had a dream about you. You were you, but you were many—a multitude of mannequins, each named Manny. And I was me, but I was Dark Jar Tin Zoo, and as such I made love to you—all of you. Then I woke up alone, naked, cuddling a mannequin I named after you who smells like you, because I spray it with the same fragrance you used to wear. Is that crazy? No, I didn’t think so either.  ”



“because in the past words have only driven them apart.”



“The Auden/Kallman relationship had this to be said for it: It affirmed that it's better to be blatant than latent.”

“i want to say to her: i just want to be myself. and i want to be with someone who's just himself. that's all. i want to see through all the performance and all the pretending and get right to the truth.”



“I don’t have cookie-cutter relationships, Rumi. Women aren’t iPhone apps that I download and discard!”

“There was once a spirited feral mustang broken in by her stern rider. It was a harmonious relationship for the most part but, like any relationship, she tested the boundaries he placed on her and threw him...Would the rider, having suffered his own wound, retaliate, discipline or forgive?”

“I think this is why Ellis took so many moving pictures of us. Because he knew that people come in and out of your life, and a picture fixes them in the moment they reach out to you.”



“I had a dream about you. You had no skin or muscle on your face, and to try to conceal your bare skull you liberally applied lipstick and makeup. Your birthday was coming up, and I knew you were probably sensitive about parties that emphasize the aging process, so I decided to box up your gift in a coffin and wrap it with black wrapping paper. I got you the best gift ever too—a hooker, who happened to be dead, because that enabled me to procure a sizeable discount. ”



“But I want to see Clara, Charlie's friend, who's right up my street. I want to see her because I don't know where my street is; I don't even know which part of town it's in, which city, which country, so maybe she'll enable me to get my bearings.”



“I had a dream about you. We were in a canoe, and we were paddling across the desert. You said you were thirsty, and I pointed to the sand that surrounded us and said, “No, I will not urinate in your mouth.” At that point I woke up, because I realized I really had to pee—and get a drink of water. ”



“You can have a pet zebra and put that zebra into a small cage every day and tell the zebra that you love it, but no matter how you and the zebra love each other, the fact remains, that the zebra should be let out of that cage and should belong to someone who can treat it better, the way it should be treated, someone who can make it happy.”

“When jealousy rears up, it indicates that something inside of you is afraid. It's an alarm, nothing less and nothing more. Treat it as such.”




“It suddenly struck me that Dawsey is a lonesome person. I think it may be that he has always been lonely, but he didn't mind before, and now he minds.”



“So, a little advice. Relax. You're not filling a job position. You're looking for a pleasant acquaintance.. who might become a good friend... who turns out to be attractive to your senses... and a rewarding lover... then a committed partner whose heart will not stray. If you don't see those signposts and in that order, then you're probably on the wrong road and getting more lost with every step.”



“When you begin with the premise "I treat everyone equally," you have already blinkered yourself from seeing where you don't, or can't, or shouldn't. There is no way to treat two people equally, because they are each unique, with respective strengths and weaknesses.”



“The only humility that is really ours is not that which we try to show before God in prayer, but that which we carry with us, and carry out, in our ordinary conduct; the insignficances of daily life are the importances and the tests of eternity, because they prove what really is the spirit that possesses us.”



“It's a false premise to say that most monogamous people have chosen monogamy. Most people belong to the religion they were raised in...because that's what's familiar. That's the milieu they grew up in, and, for better or worse, they're just continuing the pattern. Until this traditionalist mindset is shaken loose, you would likely try from reflex to impose notions onto nonmonogamy that are not only untenable in the new context but spel sudden and messy doom even in situations that otherwise could be worked out.”



“Let them see that you trust them & let them solve their own problems, make their own decisions.Do that & they will commit their lives to you. Bully the, control them out of fear or malice or just for your own convenience, & after a while you'll have to spend all your time thinking for them, controlling them, & stifling their resentment.”



“The red firelight glowed on their two bonny heads and revealed their faces, animated with the eager interest of children; for, though he was twenty-three and she eighteen, each had so much of novelty to feel, and learn, that neither experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.”



“I will be on the look out for you, my dear girl," he wrote. "You must expect to give yourself up when you come." For this buttoned-up age, for Burnham, it was a letter that could have steamed itself open.”



“Use every opportunity of humbling yourself before your fellow-men as a help to abide humble before God.”



“In a sane world, a term like "chronic crisis" would be instantly seen by anone as an oxymoron. Nevertheless, that's the state that many of us Western Worlders live in, provoking crisis after crisis so that we can justify our dis-ease rather than addressing that directly.”



“I would see him, Edward.'
It was no request; he knew it to be an ultimatum. He shook his head violently, not trusting his voice. Time passed. She was staring at him, saying nothing, and on her face was a look of stunned disbelief, of anguished accusation he knew would haunt him for the rest of his life. But when she spoke, her voice held no hint of tears. It was not a voice to offer either understanding or absolution, spoke of no quarter given, of a lifetime of love denied.
'God may forgive you for this,' she said, very slowly and distinctly, 'but I never shall.”



“Joe Spork opens the door. The man departs. Joe turns to Polly to say something about how they’re obviously not going to Portsmouth, and finds an oyster knife balanced on his cheek, just under his eye.
“Can we be very clear,” Polly Cradle murmurs, “that I am not your booby sidekick or your Bond girl? That I am an independent supervillain in my own right?”
Joe swallows. “Yes, we can,” he says carefully.
“There will therefore be no more ‘Say hello, Polly’?”
“There will not.”



“Relationships tend to be flawed because they are made up of inherently flawed components, mere human beings.”



“Pa never told stories like Grandpa. Or treated the barn like family. Eli knew how Grandpa’s own pa had built the barn by hand, hauling bluestone for the foundation behind a stubborn ox with horns as wide as a tractor. How the smell of the plank walls was like family and how you never washed your chore coat so the animals would smell that you were family, too.”

“I do not know, at this point, whether Joshua Joseph Spork is the man of my life. He could be. I have given it considerable thought. The jury is still out. The issue between you and me is that you wish to deprive me of the opportunity to find out. Joe Spork is not yours to give or to withhold from me, Mr. Cummerbund. He is
mine
, until I decide otherwise. You have caused him grief, sullied his name, and you have hurt him. If anyone is going to make him weep, or lie about him, or even do bad things to him, it is
me
.”



“Attitude determines Altitude.
Winners never quit.
No venture, No gain.”

“Learning the difference between God's intervention, the devil's mischief, and PMS can lead to increased happiness.”

“Your words like wings gravity they defy.
My heart like a leaf on the wind catchin' rides.
We make too much sense to foolishly pass it by.
So I'm taking a rainbow up to the 5th floor.
Steppin' out to see that you're really worth more.”

“I knew I was waiting for someone I didn't understand.”



“Marriage is more about snore strips and flannel nightgowns than candlelight dinners.”



“He ran his fingers over the moist ends of her hair and across her face. Her eyes were wet.
Jesus Christ.
How many nights had he heard Lily crying. As some parents sleep through fire, thunderstorms, and voices at the back door only to wake at a child’s whisper, so Everett heard Lily crying at night. Her muffled sobs seemed to have broken his dreams for years. He had heard her even at Fort Lewis, even in Georgia, finally at Bliss. That was Lily crying in the wings whenever the priest came to tear up his mother’s grave. Lily cried in the twilight field where he picked wild poppies with Martha; Lily’s was the cry he heard those nights the kiln burned, the levee broke, the ranch went to nothing.”



“I could tell you of occasionally, every eon, meeting a person, with whom I might stay for a billion years. But what of it? After a billion years there is nothing left to say, and you wander apart, uncaring in the end.”



“But we'd only had so many nights together, and the notebook had so many pages, and the world was never going to get bigger.”



“But men and women are different in the way that they feel loved. Men like to be admired for what they do, for their integrity and their accomplishments, whether it’s at work or at the gym or mowing the lawn, because it makes them feel manly. When a woman tells a man that she is proud of him, or she tells him that he did a good job, he’ll about bend over backwards to take care of her and love her.”
“But women like attention from men, because it makes them feel feminine and adored. That’s why they’re always fixin’ themselves up, doing their hair, wearing pretty clothes and makeup and jewelry and perfume. It’s all to attract your attention, you know.” (Thelma Jenkins)”

“I long ago developed a very practical smile, which I call my "Noh smile" because it resembles a Noh mask whose features are frozen. Its advantage is that men can interpret it however they want; you can imagine how often I've relied on it.”

“And then I met the most wonderful boy in the world. We would take long walks by the river. We spent hours gazing into each others eyes. We were so very much in love. And then one day, he went away. And I thought I'd die, but I didn't. And when I didn't, I said to myself... is that all there is to love?”

“...we are taught to put fun and serious pursuits on a continuum as opposed extremes, when this dichotomy is entirely false, made even worse when we act as though we can instantly exchange one for the other...Exerting yourself at a task that is serious and rewarding can still be quite fun, but doing something fun because you have a neurotic need to pack your life full of un is pretty much a guarantee that any long-term benefits you derive will be entirely happenstance.”



“Sabrina Thomas clutched the leather-bound notebook to her chest and tried not to be impatient as the elevator in the south tower of Texas Hospital near downtown Dallas stopped once again on its climb to the eighteenth and top floor. But it was difficult.
Dr. Cade Mathis, the bane of her existence, would reach Mrs. Ward’s room first and then there’d be hell to pay. Sabrina jabbed the button to close the doors as soon as the last person stepped onto the already crowded elevator.”

“To the immature, other people are not real.”

“But nearly every woman I know has a roughly similar story - in fact, dozens of them: stories about being obsessed with a celebrity, work colleague or someone they vaguely knew for years; living in a parallel world in their head; conjuring up endless plots and scenarios for this thing that never actually happened.”




“She serves me a piece of it a few minutes
out of the oven. A little steam rises
from the slits on top. Sugar and spice -
cinnamon - burned into the crust.
But she's wearing these dark glasses
in the kitchen at ten o'clock
in the morning - everything nice -
as she watches me break off
a piece, bring it to my mouth,
and blow on it. My daughter's kitchen,
in winter. I fork the pie in
and tell myself to stay out of it.
She says she loves him. No way
could it be worse.”

“We are raised to believe (on the surface, at least) that us humans only have so much love to give, and that it comes in a standard round unit: one. After all, we associate love with the heart, and, well, you've either got a whole heart, or you're dead, period. You can't, common wisdom goes, just run around dividing that one heart up freely; to claim to do so means that you're either a fool, or you're dividing up something that is dead.”

“Dear 2600: I think my girlfriend has been cheating on me and I wanted to know if I could get her password to Hotmail and AOL. I am so desperate to find out. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
And this is yet another popular category of letter we get. You say any help would be appreciated? Let’s find out if thats true. Do you think someone who is cheating on you might also be capable of having a mailbox you don’t know about? Do you think that even if you could get into the mailbox she uses that she would be discussing her deception there, especially if we live in a world where Hotmail and AOL passwords are so easily obtained? Finally, would you feel better if you invaded her privacy and found out that she was being totally honest with you? Whatever problems are going on in this relationship are not going to be solved with subterfuge. If you can’t communicate openly, there’s not much there to salvage.”



“Polyamory is differentiable from some other forms of nonmonogamy (including adultery) in that it is future-oriented. Poly relationships are not located solely in the moment, but have intentions (though perhaps tacit and vaguely defined) of at least adding to a base of experience possibly so far as signifying a life-long and emotionally attached commitment.”



“It's your world, but I make my way in it. At fifteen, no, I couldn't stand up to you. The age of illusions, when we know nothing, we hope for everything; we're wandering in a mist ... And the half of the world that's never had any use for us, suddenly is besieging us. You
need
us, you
adore
us, you're suffering for us. You want everything--except to know what we think. You look deep in our eyes--and put your hand up our dress. You call us,
"Pretty thing."
That confuses us. The most beautiful woman, the highest ranked, lives half dazzled by constant attention, half stifled by obvious contempt. We think all we're good for is pleasing you--till one day, long acquaintance with you dispels the last mist. In a clear light, we suddenly see you as you are--and generally we start preferring ourselves. At thirty, I could finally say no--or really say yes. That's when you begin backing away from us. Now I'm full-grown. I pursue my happiness the same as any man.”



“Beside her, she can feel each breath he draws. How is it possible to be so close to a person and still not know what you are to each other? With baseball, it's simple. There's no mystery to what happens on the field because everything has a label -- full count, earned run, perfect game -- and there's a certain amount of comfort in this terminology. There's no room for confusion and Ryan wishes now that everything could be so straightforward. But then Nick pulls her closer, and she rests her head on his chest, and nothing seems more important that this right here.”



“She had searched for just the right guy; sensitive and gentle and willing to wait. Quite a long search, of course. She was looking for some imaginary man who cared more about having someone to talk to and see movies with than he needed to have sex, because she was just Not Ready for That.
Did I say imaginary? Well yes. Human men are not like that.”



“...whenever a woman describes a man as sweet, the dalliance is doomed.”



“All I can think is that I want her more than anything. I want her more than I've ever wanted anything, ever.”



“Time for us began to be measured by moments when we spoke, and moments when we longed to speak again.”



“Mom actually said that?" Cassie's face shown with happiness. "She always hated my math!"
"Nah," Martin said. "She was just being that way for you. She thought it was what you needed to hear. If parents told us what they really think about stuff, we could figure them out like regular people.”



“When I opened my case in the hotel, he gestured excitedly at my snakeskin sandals, turquoise suede wedges and silver-speckled jellies. “But you’ve loads of shoes,” he bellowed joyfully. I shook my head sadly. Men just don’t get it, do they? They’re definitely missing the shoe chromosome.”



“That's where your definition of attachment comes in. I'm in a monogamous relationship with two people.”



“....though modern Marriage is a tremendous laboratory, its members are often utterly without preparation for the partnership function. How much agony and remorse and failure could have been avoided if there had been at least some rudimentary learning before they entered the partnership....And that statement is equally valid for all relationships.”



“A society which sees her modesty or her "hang-ups" as a problem is necessarily a society which will not be able to get him to commit. Conversely, a society which respected modesty, or what now goes by "hang-ups", was one in which men were obligated.”



“Marriage is just an elaborate game that allows two selfish people to periodically feel that they're not.”



“Pablo's many stories and reminiscences about Olga and Marie-Thérese and Dora Maar, as well as their continuing presence just offstage in our own life together, gradually made me realize that he had a kind of Bluebeard complex that made him want to cut off the heads of all women he had collected in his private museum. But he didn't cut the heads entirely off. He preferred to have life go on and to have all those women who had shared his life at one moment or another still letting out little peeps and cries of joy or pain and making a few gestures like disjointed dolls, just to prove there was some life left in them, that it hung by a thread, and that he held the other end of the thread. From time to time they would provide a humorous or dramatic or sometimes tragic side to things, and that was all grist to his mill.”



“In an era of mass media, it is easy to believe that the more eyeballs, the more impact. But radio, television, and tracts accounted for a combined total of less than one-half of 1% of the Busters who are born again.”



“I wondered straightaway how he could sit at peace there, of an evening, with the row of heads staring down at him. There were no pictures, no flowers: only the heads of chamois. The concession to melody was the radiogram and the stack of records of classical music.

Foolishly, I had asked, "Why only chamois?"

He answered at once, "They fear Man."

This might have led to an argument about animals in general, domestic, wild, and those which adapt themselves to the whims and vagaries of the human race; but instead he changed the subject abruptly, put on a Sibelius record, and presently made love to me, intently but without emotion. I was surprised but pleased. I thought, "We are suited to one another. There will be no demands. Each of us will be self-contained and not beholden to the other."

All this came true, but something was amiss. There was a flaw - not only the nonappearance of children, but a division of the spirit. The communion of flesh which brought us together was in reality a chasm, and I despised the bridge we made. Perhaps he did as well. I had been endeavouring for ten years to build for my self a ledge of safety. ("The Chamois")”



“If your blade were as sharp as your tongue, you'd have sliced my through years ago.”



“Really to believe in human nature while striving to know the thousand forces that warp it from its ideal development-to call for and expect much from men and women, and not to be disappointed
and embittered if they fall short- to try to do good with people rather than to them- this is my religion on its human side. And if God exists, I think that he must be in the warm sun, in the kindly actions of the people we know and read of, in the beautiful things of art and nature, and in the closeness of friendships.”

“...Next thing I know you've run off to Paris and thrown yourself under the nearest Frenchman-”



“He's a sweet man whose crime was that he didn't love me quite enough, and because this wasn't much of a crime I had to make up some bigger ones.”

“I admit I get the occasional headache," I said. "I admit some of my hangovers are epic. But usually all it takes for me to bounce back is a sauna, cold-plunge pool, steam bath, massage, and wasabi to clear the sinuses".”



“flagrant, adj. I would be standing right there, and you would walk out of the bathroom without putting the cap back on the toothpaste.”



“The self is constituted within a variety of arenas and in relation to multiple traditions. Self-hood, on this understanding, is both provisional and open-ended, and critically depends on the configuration of relationships between one’s own groups and those cultures and values that are deemed ‘other’. The regulation of alterity becomes a defining attribute of self-hood, as my sense of who I am is crucially mediated by an understanding of that which I am not (paraphrasing William Connolly).”



“I'm not an ageist, and I'm not looking for a man in a certain restrictive age range, however I've found over the years that people younger than me tend to be immature. The problem with this is that, as I get older, all the good men have already been snapped up.”



“Beautiful building,” Phoebe said. Sam nodded. “Classical Revival,” he said. It was yet another display of his seemingly unending knowledge that both made her proud and made her feel very small. Maybe if she had gone to college she would have learned about building styles and understand what Classical Revival meant. They could have intelligent discussions about things like rooflines and columns.”



“Bad luck with women is a determined man's road to success. For every affliction, he makes, out of indignation, yet another advancement in order to exceed the man that the woman chose over him. This goes to show that great men are made great because they once learned how to fight the feeling of rejection.”




“This does not escape my notice, it is a context. I resent the fact of a context; my social status has shifted and no one is going to acknowldege it, that´s certain. I´m expected to be Brave and Rise Above. I dress for the role; I must look far better now that I did when I was married. I must look pulled together into a nice tight Hermès knot of self-containment. I don´t make the rules; I just do my best to follow them.”



“There is that, and there is also the Irreconcilable Differences line. It seems so catchall, so vague. You could say that about anyone, any man and woman at all. Jesus and Mary Magdalene: "Irreconcilable Differences." JFK and Jackie, anyone at all. It´s built into the man-woman thing. What kind of paltry reason is that? "Insanity" is another box to be checked on the divorce petition, the only alternative to "Irreconcilable Differences." I would like to check it.”



“To keep myself from harming or calling N and to stave off the rage and despair, I focus on my extraordinary son, drink midrange Chardonnay every night after he is asleep, and make a barrage of late-night mail-order retail purchases placed from the couch. The couch has officially become my second battle station. I am angry and I have credit And I´m all blackened inside; I should wear a pointy witch hat around Larkspur as I go to the bank and drop A off at day care. It would be more honest.”



“Clara shrugged and immediately knew her betrayal of Peter. In one easy movement she'd distanced herself from his bad behavior, even thought she herself was responsible for it. Just before everyone had arrived, she'd told Peter about her adventure with Gamache. Animated and excited she'd gabbled on about her box and the woods and the exhilarating climb up the ladder to the blind. But her wall of words hid from her a growing quietude. She failed to notice his silence, his distance, until it was too late and he'd retreated all the way to his icy island. She hated that place. From it he stood and stared, judged, and lobbed shards of sarcasm.
'You and your hero solve Jane's death?'
'I thought you'd be pleased,' she half lied. She actually hadn't thought at all, and if she had, she probably could have predicted his reaction. But since he was comfortably on his Inuk island, she'd retreat to hers, equipped with righteous indignation and warmed by moral certitude. She threw great logs of 'I'm right, you're an unfeeling bastard' onto the fire and felt secure and comforted.”



“I know I am planning to visit a "land" that is not entirely foreign, only foreign to me. As an adventurer, I am on a journey that I believe will last me my whole life. A new relationship, discovery, or awareness excites me.”



“He tries to force the anger down, but it's like an anvil on his chest. He closes his eyes, like Sammy taught him, and forces the anvil up; he softens.”



“You know what really fries my Puerto rican pancakes?”



“Back at home, days later, feel cranky and tired. Sit on the couch and tell him he's stupid. That you bet he doesn't know who Coriolanus is. That since you moved in you've noticed he rarely reads. He will give you a hurt, hungry-to-learn look, with his James Cagney eyes. He will try to kiss you. Turn your head. Feel suffocated. (from "How")”



“This is what we had become, after the first symbiotic year of our living together: a couple who needed another couple to be around.”



“Moreover, in conversations with women, men do most of the talking (Haas,
1979), and despite hackneyed stereotypes about women being more talkative
than men, we're apparently used to this pattern. When people listen to record-
ings of conversations, they think it's more disrespectful and assertive for a
woman to interrupt a m~ than vice versa (Lafrance, 1992).”



“Cyphel knew exactly how he felt about her as well — it was there in her expression whenever they spoke that beguiling combination of amusement and haughtiness that she carried off so well. It was a look that expressed disdain at Campion’s guarded advances but also a kind of measured probationary respect as well. It was a look that said You dare to think that I will find you as interesting as you obviously find me Well perhaps in that very act of daring you become interesting to me if only fleetingly.”

“Do you mind?” she asked.
“Mind what?”
“While you were looking in the mirror I couldn’t help myself and I began fantasizing about you. And I figured if I was going to continue to fantasize about you, the only polite thing to do was to ask your permission. So now I’m doing the polite thing again and asking, ‘do you mind?’”
“No, Nina. I don’t mind at all.”
Then she leaned down and kissed him.”



“The lamb baa-ed vigorously as Mary dragged it into the manicure room, and Zel winced. She really should insist Julie come work, She could use the help, plus it would mean extra mother-daughter time--and, Zel thought wryly, I won't have to find a spare tower in the suburbs.
Closing the appointment book, Zel went to finish trimming Linda's hair. "Did I hear a sheep out there?" Linda asked.
"Sick dog," Zel said. "Now, bend your head down." Linda obeyed and Zel ran her fingers through the back of her hair to check for evenness. All she needed to do was think of a way to make Julie come without Julie immediately assuming her mother was trying to ruin her life. Not an easy task.”



“Couples will no longer spend their nights in their houses dedicated to habitation and reception, the customary social reason for banalization. The chamber of love will be more remote from the center of the city: it will completely naturally re-create for the partners the notion of ex-centricity, in a place less open to the light, more hidden, in order to return to the atmosphere of the secret. The contrary move, the search for a center of thought, will proceed by the same technique.”



“[M]an is not an island, he is more like a spaghetti junction.”



“Miss Austen’s novels … seem to me vulgar in tone, sterile in artistic invention, imprisoned in the wretched conventions of English society, without genius, wit, or knowledge of the world. Never was life so pinched and narrow. The one problem in the mind of the writer … is marriageableness.”

“Discover the fulfillment of intimate relationships with flesh-and-blood neighbors and teammates in concrete place and time, and we escape the pressure of mainstream media to channel intimacy only as virtual embrace.”

“- Она... они то разъезжаются, то опять... Всё время как на вокзале...
(Витька Мохов - отцу Михаилу Мохову о своей матери)”



“Он всегда был счастлив при встрече с Цезарем, оба они радовались. Но радовались, кажется, неодинаково. Чек - откровенно и ясно, весь он был как на ладони. А Втька не мог отвязаться от скрытого смущения и тайной виноватости. Дело в том, что Чек был уверен: они дружат на равных. И Витьке приходилось притворяться, что это так. А в душе-то он относился к Цезарёнку как к младшему, которого надо защищать и оберегать. Впрочем, это одна сторона. А другая... Бывает, что друг меньше по годам, слабее по силам, а ты понимаешь, насколько он крепче духом и яснее душой. И ты благодарен ему за то, что он выбрал в самые лучшие друзья именно тебя.”



“Я хочу встретить такого мужчину, который, когда узнаешь его получше, будет таким же, каким кажется, когда вы только познакомились.
Я хочу встретить такого мужчину, который звонит, если пообещал позвонить и приходит домой, если пообещал, что придет.
Я хочу встретить такого мужчину, которого устраивает то, какой он есть.
Я хочу встретить такого мужчину, который хочет встретить такую женщину, как я.
Ведь это не слишком много? Хотя, как утверждает моя подруга Марсель, это все равно, что хотеть луну с неба и звезды впридачу.”



“Gott weiß, wie schwer es mir fällt Beziehungen zu genießen. Ich verhalte mich immer wie ein Geheimdienstler, der seinen Partner als Doppelagent enttarnen will.”



“I like my duck eggs cooked like I like my relationships: Over easy.”



“The best people in our life will make us realize our worth and won't make us feel unworthy.”

“I was married to Erma for almost forty years, you can't be jealous of my memories”



“Once the distance between a text message and 'Send' grows from minutes to months, it hardly gets reversed.”

“A great Russian writer once wrote that happy families are all alike, while each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Like all oft-quoted lines from bona fide geniuses, it remains a truism beyond question and yet from the moment I first read that famous first line I had my doubts. Raised, as I was, in an unhappy family that shattered apart before I was out of the single digits, I always believed the exotic and differentiated lives were lived on the other side of the dividing line between happy and not. The happy families I knew seemed to burst with possibilities; the permutations of their varied interests and eccentricities, the diversity of their achievements, the myriad of strange traditions and customs culled from their everyday happiness seemed unending.”



“There's no point in having hope from someone who gives you only excuses and not their time.”

“It's been creeping up on me ever since I got to the island what my relationship with Thomas really is: something that should've ended a few months after it began in eighth grade, when he started treating me like an afterthought. But it didn't. Because there was something almost comfortable about that. I was used to it.”



“... Maureen managed to say: "It's not easy, pairing yourself off with someone forever. It's an admirable thing, and I'm glad you're both doing it, but, boy-oh-girl-oh, there will be days you wish you'd never done it. And those will be the good times, when it's only days of regret and not months.”



“In a rose, all love stories fit, and in a love story the air smells of roses”

“He looked a little wounded, and I realized that true power came from not caring about anyone. That was the last time I would sleep with a man. I was through with the gender.”




“Don't worry about your orgasm. Don't care about it. You've had a million orgasms in your life. Want only this. Want only total obliteration. In this way too, you are returning to the girl you were -- the girl who didn't care about orgasms, but just wanted to fuck, and fuck, and fuck, without even knowing why. Those adult years of dutifully chasing clitoral orgasms -- they seem alien in retrospect. Now you just want sensation, less definable than orgasm, and weirdly more satisfying, more total.”



“Jess herself seemed resolutely asexual, though I later of torrid affairs, and complex intrigues. This quality of holding back was very important for me to see. She'd held herself apart a little. She didn't pretend she wasn't beautiful, there was nothing coy in her, but she wasn't very interested in using her beauty's power. That fascinated me. I had never thought of that as an option. Just letting your beauty lie around, unused. She was a model of a different way of being.”



“When the subject was 14, late in the year of 1980, she began to pursue male attention, like the cartoon cat who turns around and begins to chase the dog. From there on out, her pursuit was dedicated, the subject was never without a boyfriend, or several. She seemed to need to stack them, like cordwood, for winter. Sexual activity was ongoing, occasionally fervent, but usually desultory, or mechanical, or dutiful. What this study is attempting to ascertain is why. Why did she do this?”



“An aside on the question of pleasure. The subject didn't really get much pleasure from all this fornicating she was doing. The compulsion wasn't to feel good, it was to enjoy the feeling of making someone want her, of making someone else feel good. Frequency of condition was high, in fact constant.”



“Whatever your opinion of frequent sexual congress, let us assume for the purpose of this study that sensual sex should provide an increase in personal happiness, which was a widely held belief during the era we are discussing. A visual expression of the data we compiled regarding the subject's sexual activity shows happiness decreasing as sexual activity increases.”



“If trust does not exist in a relationship, then nothing else matters.”

“For as long as I’ve known him, even at our worst, he’s brought sunlight to rival my poor weather.”



“One is able to forgive someone only when he is really unable to prepare himself to lose that relationship at any cost”

“With drugs, people almost universally want them more than they end up liking them. With sex it can be the other way around. People can end up liking sex more than they initially wanted it, especially as both men and women get older, and with more time in a relationship.”



“Why didn't I feel like this when we were actually together?"
"Maybe... maybe your mango wasn't ripe."
I squinted at Cat. "I'm not following. You're going to have to take me there."
"There's a part in
You've Got Mail
when Kathleen and Joe have been hanging out together. Joe knows their online identities, but she doesn't. And they go to the farmers' market, and before parting ways she says, 'I hope your mango's ripe,' and he gives her this considering look and tells her that he thinks it is."
"That is a very obscure reference."
"The point is, the mango was a metaphor for their relationship. He'd waited until she'd grown and softened under the sunlight, and once she'd gotten there, he made his move---both before and after revealing his identity.”



“Show people who they can be. Instead of telling them who they shouldn't be.”



“It is only when both the parents contribute in raising their child that they keep their partnership alive.”



“I haven't spoken to him since before that. I never understood how he could just drop me like that. Is it a Korean thing? I mean, what kind of person does that?”



“A couple that can argue well can also live together well. This does not mean that arguing is valued in and of itself. However, conflict is inevitable when two different people try to share their lives at many different levels. It is very important that neither is scared to speak up. It is vital that each can honestly say how they feel and what they think. Each must know that they are respected, even if disagreed with. Only in this way, can a genuine, open, and deep bond be grown between the two.”



“When we love another person, it is we who love. The other may ignite our love but it is we who decide to love. We need to magnify our decision to love whether people love us or not.”



“Self-oriented people are inclusive only of those they believe will further their own motives and causes. More evolved people understand that inclusivity is the most productive and positive way to be. As such, their endeavours are life-enhancing, successful, and significantly contributory. Truly inclusive people do not gossip, listen to gossip, seek to pull other people down, view competition as a play of personal power, or try to gain benefit from someone else’s suffering. Instead, their eyes, mind, and talents are directed towards whatever is best for everyone in any given situation.”



“Working hard never goes waste. Especially when it comes to your relationships.”

“Caring too much for someone who doesn't care for you can make you emotionally drained too.”

“The issues that you avoid harm your relations more than the issues you fight over.”

“Even after you've spent years staying together with someone, you'll never truly know them if they are emotionally not connected with you.”

“Never force yourself to trust someone again, as you won't be able to trust your decisions in the future if that person betrays you again.”

“We almost never teach or learn when arguing.”

“We most commonly deceive our partners into thinking that we are not cheating on them by introducing them to our families, by sharing photos of them via social media, and/or by marrying them.”

“The person you choose to share your life with is someone who is simply along for the ride. They aren't your life itself. Your be all and end all. You merely have a mutual agreement that you're sharing a journey. So if they choose to bail, it's disappointing and hurtful of course but... the journey still continues. With all of its highs and lows and triumphs and fireworks. But now there's a free space in your car for someone who will appreciate it better. Keep going.”

“You will never find the perfect job, relationship, or situation. Nothing is perfect. Our ideals in life are set by others, and it’s these set of standards they’ll want you to live by. Never live by standards set by others. Set out of your own path until you run into happiness. No matter what job, relationship, or situation. Happiness is the foundations that make all things possible.”

“Relationships are the "life" of the "body" that is a home.”



“It’s fascinating to me that those who are most toxically selfish don’t even seem to be good at it… It’s as though narcissism creates a blinder in which you can only see self-destructive paths. They can get exactly what they prayed for, mistreat it, throw it away… then act as a victim.”

“Establishing a company from scratch can be challenging. It requires 100% commitment. However, your priorities will demonstrate your true commitment. Without commitment, it is impossible to achieve success in anything, whether it be business or relationships.”



“Everyone talks about an ideal man. However, as soon as you start talking about an ideal woman, you are termed misogynistic or patriarchal. Accept women the way they are. Then why not accept men the way they are? Why do only women have the prerogative to dream of a perfect man? Why can’t a man dream of a goddess?”




“It is said it is useless to look for equality in a relationship. Whether you want it or not, one always leads, and the other follows. Maybe we should give matriarchy a chance. But the weight should always be towards one side. As long as we compete for equality, none of us will lead, and none of us will follow.”



“I was free. And that is exactly why it was so horrifying.”



“The world
was whole because
it shattered. When it shattered,
then we knew what it was.”



“One way to enhance your mindfulness in relationships is to become a “collector of emotional moments.”



“One way to enhance your mindfulness in relationships is to become a 'collector of emotional moments.”



“Focus on being interested, not interesting.”



“Every action creates a reaction. This much is true. The goal here for conflict resolution and peacekeeping purposes is thus to understand what caused the first action; it is Self* which then discovers that there is nothing to argue about nor that there is anything to fight over for One's very own purpose it is Companionship, it is Friendship, it is Love. (* Humanity)”

“I think I’m looking for someone that has, not the qualities I have always wanted in someone, but rather, all the qualities I didn’t know I wanted.”



“I don't know why people try to be friends with their exes. I mean, we were never friends, so why try after having decided that an intimate relationship isn't going to work? Friendships are intimate, too. You can't just, like, turn the connection down a notch and hope to make it better. It's still the same connection, and if it's faulty it's going to stay faulty.”



“Writing is therapeutic,
Ultimate Catharsis…
Venting tool.
Exploring a world on your own terms…”



“The expectation of fulfillment in relationships will always fail you”



“Every action has a preceding cause.
Find the first cause and realize peace.”

“If you avoid conflict, you may not speak up in many situations because you value harmony over all else. While this might make others find you super easy to work with, if you’re never speaking your truth, you probably have out-of-balance relationships. Relationships where you’re overfunctioning.
Similarly, if you have strong opinions, you might inadvertently be forcing them on others, although you feel you’re being passionate. You may also tend to be too direct, which can shut other people down and damage relationships.
You might have different defaults in different situations. Some people are more forceful at work but give in easily with family, or vice versa. By recognizing patterns in your own behavior, you’ll be better able to adjust in ways that’ll help you get your relationships back in balance.
And if you’re up for a little truth-telling, it’s not a bad idea to ask people around you what they think your default is. Sometimes we have blind spots, and it’s hard to be honest with ourselves.”



“I never want to be in a relationship where time away from one another is the reward.”

“The truth is, being a parent is mostly just reacting. Sometimes you get it right and sometimes you don't. You give what you can. And at the end of the day, most of it is just being there.”



“I started out trusting everyone and assuming they would always do the right thing when they were supposed to, despite the situation. I grew up on the golden rule. The 10 Commandments and all these morals and values about right and wrong and being truthful and loyal.
Then, I was betrayed. I was hurt, talked about, lied on, shunned, condemned, shamed, embarrassed, humiliated, and left broken by so many people including those who were close to me and those I would have given my last to- those I did give my last to; all while they were taking, stealing and robbing from me financially, emotionally, physically and psychologically.
So now, obviously my approach to people would be different. My perception has changed. Now, when I see people, I don’t automatically trust them. I don’t trust them at all.”

“I have the potential to look like a Super Hero, and so I must watch what I wear”

“She will gasp for air when she sees you. She will exhale. That's how you know when it's your wife. When you notice that your presence took her breath away, she falls into your arms, and you become one.”

“No longer looking for someone to sing over a beat. I want someone to rhyme with. Let's create music together. Let's harmonize and decide how the words should fall”

“Jonathan's apologies are works of art; they are three-act plays. He apologized, and I accepted that apology, therefore it must be over and done with. Except that I still feel the ring of those words. I still feel the weight of the abrupt realization of where I stand in the pecking order of Jonathan's life, the realization that if this, my mother's sudden death, is not significant enough, then there is nothing I can ever do to move up the order.”



“You feel lost when you start losing touch with the people who are the only source of the smile in your life.”

“Über Liebe, als Beziehung zwischen den Geschlechtern gebe es nichts Neues mehr zu berichten, das habe die Literatur dargestellt in allen Varianten ein für allemal, das sei für die Literatur, sofern sie diesen Namen verdient, kein Thema mehr - solche Verlautbarungen sind zu lesen; sie verkennen, daß das Verhältnis zwischen den Geschlechtern sich ändert, daß andere Liebesgeschichten stattfinden werden.”



“she said
i want you to
meet him
you'll like him
really
yeah
i thought
like car crash
broken glass
rusty razored underwear
barbed wire cheer
acid fear
like walking down
normandie
naked
nightly
like tiger claws 'n
earthquake falls
i'll
really relish meeting 'm.”



“A woman, unless she is an idiot, sooner or later meets a piece of human wreckage and tries to rescue him. She sometimes succeeds. But a woman, unless she is an idiot, sooner or later finds a sane, healthy man and makes a wreck of him. She always succeeds.”



“Of all the religions and spiritual groups in the world, why do we end up in one or, sometimes, a few? With all the people in the world, why do we closely bond with a relative few? It is destiny, karma. It is internally driven by the need for lessons and the working out of karma from past forgotten associations, agreements prior to being born, and that which will give us specific learning opportunities. Some bonds arise and then release, and some bonds remain intact. Sometimes, we cannot tell whether something is beneficial long-term. So, we let time and the flow of events decide for us. There is nothing to prove. We submit to the divine process – not another and not our own ego. It is true humility and makes us invulnerable to domination by any other human. Fear cannot capture us, criticism cannot harm us, and pride cannot make us fall.”



“There will be times when people will breach the boundaries of your heart. When it happens, seek inner forgiveness to unburden your soul from resentment.
Look back,
Each person that came into your life served a purpose.”



“Hurtful words lacerate the heart. Although it may heal over time, scars will never completely disappear.”



“All peace ends from talking about others. All peace starts from stop talking about others. So choose peace.”

“First there was one not wanting to be alone.
Then there was one purposely forgetting it was two for love.”

“I still look at Rumi’s pictures. I have men still swooning over
me, wanting to kiss me, but not love me like the love I know. I
knew. The love that came from Rumi to me and streamed from me
to Rumi.
My heart is at unrelenting unrest. There lives a void in it. I
never happen to find love or peace in whatsoever I may do.”




“My world revolved around him. You know I tried. You know
well I am trying so hard but I have not been able to forget him
even for a single day, a single night, not even a single second. My
world still revolves around him. He was my star; he was my sun.
Once a Sun, always a Sun, my life still orbits around him. I wish
he would know. Actually, no Nayna, he knew, he always knew.
He knew. And still, he left without looking at me, without saying
anything to me.”



“Between what was said and taken to be true, what was not,
and yet our hearts knew it to be true. Our love got lost… lost! Our
celebrated capital love got lost. Time narrated a different story.
Or, is it that he was the narrator, narrated one story of love, and
enacted another of betrayal?”



“You are thinking too much Roo. You are draining yourself.
Some things are out of our reach. We cannot know everything. We
cannot control everything. But we can control ourselves.
Happiness is right within us. It is inside you! He did not wave a
magic wand to make you happy. You were always happy. You
made him happy and so he loved you. He loved you because you
are so lovable. It is difficult not to love you. You are a cracker of
happiness and fervour. And now strength! So better not lose
either.”



“Every corner of my home talks of him, every!
Every article talks to me of Rumi and I could not say that to Nayna.
As I pace around and gently touch all the surfaces, my heart
cries out— come back... Don’t stay away, please! My home never
felt like home without you.”



“Months start to become years-- crying and coming out of the
pain he left me in, trying to wean off his constant presence in my
head. But the pain never leaves, and the void never fills. The pain
he left me in, happens to be more devoted, in contrast to the love
he left in me.”



“My wings clipped; my flight, restricted with his absence!
They say a penguin mates for life. Well, mostly. I need no
flight, just get me my wings. I pray out of lost hope.”



“A smile does not anymore touch and settle in me like a peal of
laughter. It is just another effete smile that flies by as softly as it
flies in.
Quiet is what I have become. Perpetually!”



“Love confirms hope and rejects cynicism, and he chose cynicism over love.”



“He left, and I hate him for that. Even though I am never able
to, in the true sense of the word, hate him but I certainly hold a
disfavour towards his act, for… um… for not talking to me, for
not sorting his concerns out, for just leaving me alone due to just
one darn fear. When we could have fought that fear together, and
gradually seen it diminish, but he rather thought it better to just
leave than give us a chance. Perhaps so I’d be happy with another.
But, happy-me meant, being with him. There never could be
another, none like him. And he knew that well, very well!”



“I still do not know if this is love but it does feel like love. The
good old love the way parents do, as we see it. The configuration
is perhaps the same, the manifestation is altered. But at least, it
feels like a lasting song of love not just the one we make love to…”



“I feel like I am at a fork in the road of life.
Combatting for answers I feel impotent and close my eyes to
pray to the Almighty-- give me strength God, give me strength. I
do not want to fall. But I also know I am tripping here. I cannot
hide it anymore. I am losing out on my strength to go on.
Please—I say out loud in my shaky voice— PLEASE, be with
me. I have been stranded enough. You also don’t leave my side.
Please don’t. Tears start to trickle down my eyes as if the oceans
have decided to make their exit through them.
I open my eyes and happen to see myself in the mirror afront--
once a glow-emanating expressive face, now, a deadpan face only
emanating sorrow.”



“You bring
happiness to one and all around you. All you have to do is
rummage within yourself and let my Roohi step out in the open
again. Let her out, do not chain her inside to fester, along with
your pain. Once you see yourself beaming like you once did, you
will not feel so crushed. Just work on smiling straight from the
heart. Everything else will fall in place.”



“Life teaches my love, allow yourself to see what it is
beseeching you to see—come what may, remain true to your own
being by not letting someone dilute your true self. Earn what you
deserve! Come what may get back up and wrestle back the pain
that pushes you down, even if you think you have no strength left.
Take a jab at it and conquer! Come what may piece yourself
together, even if it is one day at a time. Own your struggle! Come
what may never take yourself to be fragile. Strength is you, my
girl!”



“The memories may not go far
from us but someone’s love may make them dimmer. With all
your true heart, know what it wants. Does it want happiness or
does it obstinately want Rumi… back? First, answer this to
yourself and then try. Happiness will happen on its own then!”



“Dominate your thoughts! Try to keep your thoughts in check.
That is what lies within your purview, so work on that. Please do not try to alter life with what you may want. It will not change its
course basis your wants. While you try with all your true heart, if
you are still-- scared, be! Unsure of the future, be! But also, be
discreet with the experience that life has left you with, till now.
And use it well for your future.”



“Open up to
your inner thoughts, of the present and the future, not of the past,
and do not shut your eyes and ears to them.”



“I have got the reins of my life in my hands and I must not let
myself topple over some mishap. I must put an end to my
tinkering with my own true peace and happiness. I thought my
peace lay with a person, but it domiciles right within me. In my
willingness to let it proliferate within me, once again.”



“I take a deep breath and tell myself to put one foot at a time, in
the seemingly cold waters of love, once again. I tell myself-- love
will infuse its warmth in me. Love isn’t cold, my heart is. It needs
warmth.”



“Love is painful. Or, love is a beauty that, if leaves, leaves
scarred remains.
Perhaps, love left me scarred.
Or! Love is forever a beauty, that lives forever. Rather. People
leave. People leave pain. People leave people, scarred. People
leave people, without answers they deserve to hear. People smear
the name of love.”



“I love my enemies; they teach me more than my friends do.”



“People can use you only if you allow them to.”

“Trusting you again gave me more pain.”

“Not having someone doesn't hurt as much as being ignored by someone.”

“Never force yourself to forgive someone.”

“Don't make your problem everyone else's problem too.”

“I would recall my mission in life - pleasuring men. That was my condition, my status. And so I would offer my services anew, with renewed zeal, and with a simulated conviction that I even managed to convince myself was real. I faked it. I faked enjoying sex, faked my pleasure, faked knowing what the point of it all was. Deep down, I was ashamed of being able to do it all so instinctively, when others had barely experienced their first kiss.”



“Love is a satire
Melody in key of destruction”

“He was basically a care-bear trapped in the body of an underwear model. I was confused by him for months. Why was he so bad at flirting? Why did he do all the things he said he was going to do? Why was he so damn happy all the time? What was I missing? I wasn’t going to fall for him, obviously, because it was too much. Where was the bullshit, the mindfuckery that made relationships so exciting and traumatic?”

“I don't see the people to become like them, I just want to understand them whenever they need me.”

“If not for the love and
support of parents, children can never be!”




“If only, it were written on men’s faces how they would
eventually be, things could work. Relationships would thrive. But
my darling, only time is the real deal and the answer to one’s
integrity. Time reveals one’s allegiance. People are, who they are.
Their intentions, however, either get revealed or change over a
period of time. Hard truth!”



“Listen, I am your mother, nonetheless, I am saying this to
you. And these may not have been the wisest two cents in our
times, but perhaps, are in today’s times—love, you take your time
to get married, no rush. Know a guy, well, very well, before you
engineer lofty dreams in your head and heart, and take the big
step. I do not care about the world; I care about my daughter and
her heart more than anything else.”



“If I were to give a name to
people's lives, I'd first give to mine and call it-- Blessing.”



“I look at my much in love parents, and their cutest ever tiffs.
How they get back to talking because they cannot just, not talk, to
each other, for too long. They sulk, and talk, but talk. Never a day
without talking. Such, is how love should be. I look at them and
my cup runneth over!”



“Parents’ love is not conscious, rather it is ethereally organic.
Parents’ love is not seasonal. Their love is a voluntary decision to
be with their offspring, no matter what. Their love does not need
answers, confirmation, validation, or acceptance. It thrives on its
own and overflows like the purest waters from the mountains,
irrespective of what it may have to cascade through. The deepest
cockles of my heart reverberate with their love and keep me on the
go.”



“The feeling of love is astounding. Never, can it ever be
forgotten—to be loved and to love! One marvel of a feeling,
which, if touches you, consider yourself bestowed.”



“The exhilarating knowledge of a long-desired tryst with the lover,
the vigour, the traction within the insides, and the delirium is so
atop a hill.”



“The daunting world of love can turn the freest, the
uncomplicated, and the most perfunctory souls into thoroughly
love-struck creatures, at lightning speed. Think of it-- from a
freelancer to a full-fledged employee.”



“From here on, nothing about each other is hidden from us, not
our hearts, not our minds, not our bodies, not our souls.”



“Years start to pass by but our desire for each other does not
pass us by. The “spice” that he brings into my life remains as
peppery and savoury as ever. The beauty and warmth I bring to his life, remain as enlivening as ever. Together, we cultivate a loving
relationship that lights us both.”



“Between pampering each other, hell lot of teasing, making
love, and then pampering each other more, we get abundantly
used to each other. We never say, every other day, that we know
we cannot be apart from each other. We just do not want to be.
We like it together and we just know that we shall be together, for
life.”



“To talk is as easy as falling off a log. To say what your heart
loves. Or, not. But we still do not say it. All we have to do is rummage through ourselves and say it out loud to the people we
love. It is all within us—the love, the will, the strength, the
courage, and the hope!”



“To say out loud, the love we have in us for the one we have it
for does not hurt, any of us. But, to not say out loud, it hurts two
of us. It hurts like a thrust to the chest. A thrust so pushing, that it
becomes enervating to breathe.”



“Love will always be like
love in every clock of time. The measure of love will never differ
with time… love has, and always will make the heart flutter and
soul fly. Love is the conduit to happiness and life, and shall
always be.”



“If there is love, your heart tells you, each day, in
nanoscopic things. With time, time tells you. Until then, you love
with all your true heart. Be honest, to yourself and to your love.
Never lie—it goes against the grain of love, to lie in love. Love
him and let him love you. But most of all, talk and understand
each other!”



“Food is over-rated when it comes to love. It is
not the way to live in someone’s heart. Your oxytocin hormones
are not the answer to it either. These are vital elements, but you
dwell in someone’s heart with communication. Love thrives on
the gospel truth of communication. Everything else shall wane and
wither away with time. But, if true communication, is held all
through by lovers, it shall make the two, walk hand in hand,
together till the end!”



“Roohi- Rumi, what is this love?
Rumi- Love is—when, endearingly, I look at you, and you look back at me with equal intensity…!
Roohi asserts- Equal or more!
Rumi bows with a smile.
Rumi- What say, you, my Roohi?
Roohi- Love is-- the lifeblood of life! You are my love! You, are my lifeblood!”



“Will you always talk to me? Will you always tell me
what your heart desires? Will you always tell me what it does not?
Will you always share your thoughts with me? Will you always
love me?”



“Rumi- He whispers into my ear, “Yes. Special—are YOU, and my
love for you, Milady!
All I want, is to love you more, each day.
To be with you, each day. To bring you flowers and everything
that brings forth your sumptuous smile. If it were within my reach,
I would make each day special for you.
He says with such
effortless grace that I go weak in my knees.
Roohi- Sir, if you would so permit, I would like a mouthful of your
tranquil eyes, squidgy cheeks, and succulent lips. That would
bring me smiles and much more.”



“I want to soak in deep inside me, every bit of this blissful
moment so it rests with me forever, just like his love.”



“Your eyes hold me heretofore. Your heart
holds mine with all its lure. Hold me so, I never can part, from
your embrace and love so pure.”



“The
summit of love is the two lovers being together, for life, through a
marriage where they engage in a shared path of life with all their
will and heart.”



“Our
behemoth love shall shatter all impediments, including fear.
Rumi… don’t you want to will our vision of love into reality...?”



“I am not me anymore. He changed me into someone.
Someone sentient of feelings. Someone who loved being loved by
him. Someone who loved doing things which I would never even
dream of doing, but I did, and happily, for him. And, then, one day
he thought he could leave. He snaffled me from the world, and
then he left me for the world.”



“He did not talk… He just stayed quiet. And left. He could
have just talked. The same old Rumi, my Rumi, did not talk and
just left me. My Rumi, who could talk to me through his eyes, did
not even look into mine, maybe from fear that I would see what
was writ large in them. He did not let me. He just left. My Rumi,
is no more my Rumi. He is, just Rumi.”



“Malignancy of any communication that
should, but does not happen-- it constantly makes the relationship
deteriorate. The irony is, even in its absence, communication
makes its presence felt with the coldness that creeps into the
relationship. It slowly gets malignant for the bond to sustain, so
eventually, you cut the relationship off while it slowly dies.”



“am still unable to
imagine my life without him. I cannot imagine my days without
him. I cannot see a life without him. I cannot think straight. I
cannot gather what happened, and what fear, so grave, crept into
him, that he had to just up and leave. Or, was it all a sham to hide
something deplorable from me? I am so petrified Nayn, I am petrified. What will come of me now, what will?!”



“Why do people leave, Nayna? Why do they just leave? Why
do they come into people’s lives if they have to leave? Why do
they shower love if they cannot do it forever? Why do they ask for
love if they do not know how to keep it secure? Why do they
make promises that they do not intend to keep? Why do they even
evoke love in you? Why do they say “for life” if they do not mean
it?”



“Months keep elapsing and I get used to being the way I am--
alone. Not knowing how to love another man. Not knowing how
to trust again. Not knowing how to tell my own self that I can still
be with someone and also give myself away. Again.
The thought of ‘again’ terminates everything inside me. If
truth be told, the thought of being with someone and getting used
to his things, the mere thought repulses me. I loved a man with all
my heart and I do not know how to do that once again. I do not
even feel like attempting it.”



“« But I do want something big and wild, (..) I’m convinced that when you’re with the right person, every date, every day feels that way. »”




“It took me years to figure this out the hard way: Look for people who have the same energy as you. No matter how special or attractive someone's energy is, if it doesn't match yours, trust me, you'll never feel the same way you will with someone who genuinely resembles you.”

“And why is it somehow a mark against your strength to admit that there is someone, who happens to be male, worth returning to?”



“Nothing hurts more than knowing that you are not good enough for someone you truly love.”

“I love you, but that doesn't mean that I have to always agree with you.”

“Let them go if they always have an excuse to stay away from you.”

“Night was the real measure of love, Hortensia thought. Anything can sparkle in the daylight. But night – that was when humanity got tested. It was always at night that she saw things between them were decrepit and ugly.”



“Sometimes you believe in some people more than you and if you have such person in your life then keep him/her safe with you at any cost.”

“The sad thing about sadness is it comes at the wrong time for the right thing.”

“If you want to understand me deeply then go and read my quotes because they are based on me and my real life experiences.”

“You can't convince everyone for everything.”

“Never argue with people who just want to prove their point.”

“People take many great things for granted until they lose them.”

“Accept the rejection and move on.”

“It's okay if people reject you too many times not everyone deserves great opportunities and not everyone deserves to work with great people.”

“There are no coincidences in life. Everything happens for a very personal reason. You always attract what you want the most, even when you are not seeing it. And you will never see it until you are prepared to accept it. But the potential to understand yourself and grow both spiritually and mentally, the possibility of finding the answers you have been seeking, the possibility of reaching for your dreams, is equivalent to the perception of another, as well as the emotions you assimilate within a dynamic you can't control. It would be naive to call it love, because real love is found only when paths cross each other, not from the angle of what is observed but rather the angle of desire. And in this situation, to give is to receive; to offer, is to gain; to lose, is to win. When you understand that the mystery of life unfolds itself through the emotions you attract to your life, you will also understand that any limitation, such as distance, location and time, are illusions that will only distract you from a dream that awaits for you in the eyes of someone else. People often fear such experiences, but only because of their past mistakes. The nature of the experience never changes, but fears do lead people to a repetition of cycles.”

“People like me
don't come around
once we are broken
by a careless hand.”



“Every other moon, sun, comet, planet, and star is itself a center, and extorts its own force upon all the rest. Nothing in the universe stands alone”



“Some people you cannot trust precisely because they mean well.”

“The pull outwards (of the couple relationship) expands emotional boundaries; pushing the love that is in the couple’s hearts out into the world. It is inclusive and finds ways to share the couple’s central love with the world and with life itself. However, too much moving outwards and we can forget who our partner is or even that we have a partner. Too much moving inwards and we can die from lack of air.”



“The heart carries the beat of life. It makes existence meaningful and beautiful. The heart bypasses language. It doesn’t lie. Everything moving and powerful has heart.”



“In the opening pages of Genesis, we see that our Trinitarian God made everything “good.” The only thing that is not called “good” is that our first father, Adam, was alone. He had creation below him, and God above him, but no one alongside of him to walk as an equal.”



“You have the right to maintain distance from anyone who doesn't let you be happy.”

“You can't be open about your feelings with someone who isn't open about their feelings with you.”

“Forgiving someone too many times is not bravery.”

“With time we get used to people. With time we can get not used to people too.”

“Because that was what Vasu always did with every relationship in his life—he cherished them like priceless treasures.”



“My love, this is the problem with your generation. Instant gratification,” he says, and because it took him, on average, forty-three minutes to come, because I put on the ears and the tail and learned the lyrics to “Painting the Roses Red” backward and forward, because I drank approximately five gallons of cranberry juice over the course of our relationship, and for a day or two required the use of a cane, I take issue with his definition of instant.”



“You’re the only person I ever spent time with, went out or stayed in for dinner with, hung out with. Hell, we even went with each other when visiting our families. That’s like… the most committed relationship I’ve ever been in.”



“How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!”



“... how can one human being mean so much to another human being in terms of peace and assurance, as if loyalty were as real as gravity.”




“You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.”



“We can only be a queen if we have found a man worthy to be called a king.... otherwise we got to be keep an ace up our shoulders for these jokers”

“If you mess up, I'm gonna let you know
and then i'm gonna let it go. But if you keep messing up I'm gonna let you know I gotta let you go.”

“We can only be a Queen if we have found a man worthy to be called a King...... otherwise we gotta keep an ace up our shoulder for these jokers.”

“आप उन्हें जानती भी नहीं।'
कुछ पलों की चुप्पी के बाद उन्होंने बहुत धीरे से कहा, 'जानती तो शायद मैं तुम्हें भी नहीं।”



“कभी-कभी दूरी आपको ये एहसास दिलाती है कि आप किसी के कितने करीब आ चुके हैं।”



“To know how to love and to be loved, that is the treasure which makes you and those who know you so happy.”



“The bar at rock bottom, and you had to walk through
the door.”



“Are you there?
I thought I felt you brush past me
while in-between dream and waking.
Are you the echo of light from a star long dead
or are you True North?”



“You don't question someone's loyalty when they make you feel secure by expressing their love for you.”

“I wondered which other phrases he´d plucked. I felt like a bird he kept for quills.”



“Eikö sinusta ikinä tunnu siltä että tämä on kaikki jotenkin vähän ällöttävää, kysyin. Että täytät Tomin elämässä jotain naisenmuotoista kohtaa, hän on laittanut siihen itselleen lapun että tähän joku nainen, ja sitten sinä esität sitä? Ja kun hän puhuu sinulle, niin hän oikeastaan puhuu sille mielikuvitusnaiselle ja katsoo sitä ja panee sitä, eikä sinun varsinaisilla piirteilläsi ole niin väliä?”



“I've heard people describe marriage as two missing pieces of a puzzle coming together, and discovering that they are a perfect fit. But that's just wrong. People are different and that's a good thing. Two pieces of different puzzles cannot and will not fit together, unless one has been forced to bend or break or change to fit the other”



“Most love songs are either by a man praising a woman, or by a woman complaining about a man.”

“Love gives while selfishness demands and always takes. Healthy relationship is a balance between giving and taking from each party.”

Hunderttausende gefälschte Euro-Scheine werden jedes Jahr von der Europäischen Zentralbank oder Carabinieri aus dem Verkehr gezogen. Diese betrügerischen Rechnungen haben normalerweise einen Wert von 20 oder 50, aber sie geben den Behörden genug Geld, um wachsam zu bleiben. Obwohl es schwierig ist zu beweisen, wer hinter dem Problem steckt, ist es einfach, die wahrscheinliche Quelle zu bestimmen. Es gibt drei Arten von Fälschungen: Amateure, Schurkenstaaten und hochqualifizierte Fachleute.

Der größte gefälschte Schein ist der 50-Euro-Schein, der seit zwei Jahren in den Niederlanden verwendet wird. Seit der Einführung der Währung im Jahr 2010 ist die Zahl der gefälschten Papiere jedoch zurückgegangen. Der Abwärtstrend hat sich in den letzten zwei Jahren und in Verbindung mit der Verringerung der Verwendung von Geld in Verkaufsstellen dank der COVID-19-Pandemie fortgesetzt. Trotz der zunehmenden Abhängigkeit von Plastik sind die Chancen, einen gefälschten Euro zu kaufen, sehr gering.

Der einfachste Weg, eine gefälschte Euro-Banknote zu identifizieren, ist, sie zu Hause sorgfältig zu überprüfen. Wenn Sie sehen, dass ein Souvenir im Ausland verkauft wird, kann es wie eine gefälschte Euro-Banknote oder sogar wie ein Spielzeuggeld aussehen. Stellen Sie vor dem Kauf sicher, dass es die Kriterien für eine „echte“ Note erfüllt. Die zweiseitige Multiplikation einer Euro-Banknote muss zweihundertfünfzig Prozent der Größe des Originals haben.

Wenn Sie in der Eurozone leben, ist es wichtig, den Kauf gefälschter Banknoten zu vermeiden. Obwohl es illegal ist, gibt es online eine Menge Falschgeld. Diese Gelder sind wertlos, und es ist besser, nicht auf Betrüger hereinzufallen, als Ihr Geld zu riskieren. Stellen Sie also am besten sicher, dass Ihr Geld es wert ist. Die erforderliche Anfangsinvestition beträgt etwa 200.000 Euro. Es gibt auch viele Online-Shops, die gefälschte Banknoten verkaufen.

Diese Tradition wird bis heute fortgesetzt. Die EZB ist zuversichtlich, dass die neue Banknotenserie Fälschungen verhindern wird. Die neue 20-Euro-Banknote wurde Ende 2015 in Umlauf gebracht und die überarbeitete 50-Euro-Banknote wird im April 2017 auf den Straßen erscheinen.

Trotz der Gefahren gefälschter Euro-Banknoten ist es möglich, den Ärger mit gefälschten Banknoten zu vermeiden. Die Europäische Kommission hat eine Mindest-Höchststrafe für betrügerische Euro-Produktion festgelegt und arbeitet daran, die niedrigste Strafe in der gesamten EU zu schaffen. Aber das heißt nicht, dass es sich nicht lohnt. Einige fleißige Leute drucken sogar Unmengen gefälschten Papiers zum persönlichen Vorteil. Es ist leicht zu verstehen, warum diese Arten von Falschgeld immer beliebter werden – sie sind erschwinglicher als das echte Geld und sehen professioneller aus.”

Lielākā viltotā banknote ir EUR 50, kas pēdējos divus gadus izmantota Nīderlandē. Taču kopš valūtas ieviešanas 2010. gadā viltoto papīru skaits ir samazinājies. Samazināšanās tendence ir turpinājusies pēdējos divus gadus, kā arī saistībā ar naudas izlietojuma samazināšanos tirdzniecības vietās, pateicoties Covid-19 pandēmijai.

“If a person has made it into the inner sanctuary of the heart, where few enter, then I feel they are entitled to life membership which means they will always be loved. At the same time, the relationship, itself, is not entitled to life membership. It must be earned on both sides. A good relationship is a privilege; not an entitlement. One has to prove that one is worthy of the great benefits that come from a truly alive and real partnership.”



“If a couple can’t argue well, nor will they be able to live together well.”



“We heal our past by living our present love relationship.”



“When we share our naked body, our money and our financial future, the range of our good and bad emotions, our dearest dreams and most painful memories, our trembling fears, our fragile hopes, and our sweetest and most touching joys, the relationship cannot be anything other than a uniquely powerful human opportunity. It will hold the capacity to hurt and heal in an unparalleled way. It is a unique gift to ourselves, and it is a unique gift to the other.  ”



“Without sufficient pull inwards, towards the sanctity of the couple relationship, the relationship can become lost, powerless, and vulnerable to many divisive factors including other people. Without sufficient pull outwards, into the world, we can become so selfish and inward-looking as a couple that we stop growing. The relationship can become stale and the people involved can become suffocated with their own togetherness.”



“When you’re working to find Balance in a relationship, chances are you’ll have to confront any conflict head-on. These conversations have all kinds of names, but whether you call them crucial, fierce, or difficult, they’re necessary for relationships to grow in a positive and productive way.”



“Why would you want to be there in my present if you can't promise to be there in my future?”

“I have been unbearable but I have never been unloved. I have felt alone but I have never been alone and I've been forgiven for the unforgiveable things I have done.”




“We enter into all major relationships with no real clue of where we are going: marriage, birth, friendship. We carry maps we believe are true: our parents' relationship, what it says in the baby books, the landscape of our own childhood. These maps are approximate at best, dangerously misleading at worst.”

“The joy of solitude is being nobody for anybody.”

“There is a huge difference between CONNECTION and ATTACHMENT. One gives you the power to grow, the other sucks the life out of you.”



“Polyamory (n.) Panodium.”

“A glib wisdom holds that people like this just don’t want relationships. They have “problems with intimacy.” But the salient fact is: These were relationships. In Tommy’s case, in Gary’s, and in several others they were relationships that lasted years. Intimacy for most of us is a condition that endures, however often repeated, for minutes or for hours. And these all had their many intimate hours. But, like all sane relationships, they also had limits.”



“Gus couldn't handle it when she cried. For the thirty years of their marriage, when she'd had to cry--which was always at night, at least in her memory--she'd gone downstairs after he'd gone to sleep and sat on the couch and cried. She would have liked him to comfort her, but in marriage you learn what other people's limits are. And you learn your own.”

“The truth is that happiness doesn’t come from wealth, perfect looks, or even a perfect relationship. Happiness comes from within.”

“We assign roles to all the people in our life in an attempt to master it. The roles can be reasonable or preposterous. Either way, when we realise that others do not agree to the terms of the role we have assigned to them, we get upset. Is it their fault? Surely, they are simply following their own dreams. We mustn’t invent roles for others because we think it will make us happy. Who are we to invent such things?”



“Life is a learning process from the second we leave the womb until we take our last breath. Not all our life lessons are positive ones, far from it. It’s what you do with those lessons that make the difference.”



“Each member of a couple is separate, the two come together in double attention.”



“But fibbing, including “polite” or social lies, can become part of the daily fabric of living—a way of avoiding conflict and complication that becomes so habitual we fail to notice even the fact of it and its imperceptible erosion of our integrity and our relationships.”



“I could look at him and nothing else for eternity and be happy.”

“Success is hidden in those insignificant changes on our desk, in our routines, habits and relationships which often go unnoticed year after year. Seemingly insignificant improvements lead to astonishing achievements.”



“Patience is a sign of progress.”

“When you accept everything happily, you will always find the things that make you happy.”

“Once you have experienced spirituality so well you will realise that everything you can achieve is through a combination of desire and peace.”

“It's not easy to find love and what comes easily is not love.”

“It was like I really was invisible or something and no one could see me. No, actually it was more like I was this human mirror walking down the road and all people could see when they looked in my direction with some reflection of themselves looking back because the main effect was no one saw me myself, the kid, Chappie, Bone even, no one saw me except as a way to satisfy their desires or meet their needs, the nature of which sometimes they didn’t even know about until I showed up on the scene…”



“Some people will never be highly successful not because of their lack of competence but because of the lack of welcoming new ideas and new people into their lives.”

“People are not succeeding not because of bad experiences but because of fear of bad experiences.”

“Most people in this world are living in the past or with fear.”

“Successful people are successful because they never judge anyone even after knowing them completely.”

“And without even trying, she fell in love.
Not with some guy who sent her an e-mail or posted a profile. No, she'd found someone else. Someone who'd always been around but to whom she'd never really given a second thought.
Herself.”



“I hate it when you're going to say something real then chicken out.”



“At times I think of human relationships as something soft life sand or water, and by pouring them into particular vessels we give them shape.”



“DNA doesn't make you family. Love does. Actions do.”



“Anna was pretty sure no one else at the table believed the cold relationship Bran and Leah had was a good thing. It wasn't abusive - not quite. Not physically abusive, anyway. But Anna would have lasted a month, tops, in a relationship where her needs were met with attentive care - and not an ounce of affection.”



“But when the wave of passion sweeps over her, she does not renounce the brilliant smile of life, she does not hypocritically wrap herself up in a faded cloak of female virtue. No, she holds out her hand to her chosen one and goes away for several weeks to drink from the cup of love’s joy, however deep it is, and to satisfy herself. When the cup is empty, she throws it away without regret and bitterness. And again to work.”

“I needed a man who wasn't afraid of some dirt.”



“I could not even guess that day how many more men I would say that I would say you were beautiful in dreams! But I greet, I made love, and every time… I said, I wish you remained as a dream.”




“I know myself;
After a while,
I'll pretend like you never existed
Not like you're dead.”



“To opens a woman heart,
A man needs to unlock it,
With the key of affection!”



“Home is the temple of lovers!”



“We were emotional cowards of the average world. We thought everyone we said we loved was going to leave us.”



“Do not deny it. Accept it. You can fight anything you are aware of. Even with yourself...”



“Friends... Friends you feel safe as long as they surround you. You talk to your friends separately, your heart tells it separately most of the time. You can't even name what you feel, you can't share it with the world when you can't make sense of it. Denial is your greatest weapon on that front. The more you deny it, the more you think your feelings will fade.”



“He smiled. It was a heartbroken smile. And that heart wasn't the one I broke. A thousand mistakes before me, it was a heart that had been broken many times, shattered, fastened with plasters. A dead heart that looks like beating, that looks like alive. Can you resurrect a dead heart?”



“It could not have been by chance that God sent me among so many different mentally ill people. He was obviously giving a message... He was saying, "Watch and see." Don't make the same mistakes again. Don't try to exist by shouting. Never insult the man in front of you. Learn to empathize. And knowing your limits. And to be silent. Accept. Understand. And stay away! The swamp you call a relationship is not for you right now! You die. Even I can't save you.”



“Everyone has sins
You are my biggest one.
And I do not sin that I do not know.”



“I'll take my hands off you, the waters will calm down. Let go of the blur. Let those waters remain still. More than just drifting with the current, I need to keep my head on the surface. I don't want to drown. Let me survive. Let me breathe.”



“We were the remnants of a life ruined by wrong moves.”

Did you notice that December isn't over? It never ends. Neither November nor December. They both seem to have come to stay forever. It remains. It leaves traces. When it's gone, when it's over, you won't believe it. Moreover, love is not different in November. It's just a translation fault easily. But it's a good time to force love. It is the dream of entering the new year with a new love. You do your best to find love before December ends. And sometimes, you hit a wall very bad.”



“Kalbimi açık bıraktım. Kötü anlamıyorsun, değil mi?”



“They have only one hope in their life,
Is that when they die,
They die hand in hand!”



“And he said Love is a Woman,
And Lover’s Will is to Love!”



“There’s a grey area in dating many people get hung up on — a grey area where feelings are ambiguous or one person has stronger feelings than the other. [...]
Most dating advice exists to “solve” this grey area for people. Say this line. Text her this. Call him this many times. Wear that.
Much of it gets exceedingly analytical, to the point where some men and women actually spend more time analyzing behaviors than actually, you know, behaving.”

“Why would you ever be excited to be with someone who is not excited to be with you? If they’re not happy with you now, what makes you think they’ll be happy to be with you later? Why do you make an effort to convince someone to date you when they make no effort to convince you?
What does that say about you? That you believe you need to convince people to be with you? (Hint: it implies that you wouldn’t even want to be with yourself.)
You wouldn’t buy a dog that bites you all the time. You wouldn’t be friends with someone who regularly ditches you. And you wouldn’t work a job that doesn’t pay you. Then why the hell are you trying to make a girlfriend out of a woman who doesn’t want to date you? Where’s your fucking self-respect?”

“The Law of Fuck Yes or No states that when you want to get involved with someone new, in whatever capacity, they must inspire you to say “Fuck Yes” in order for you to proceed with them.
The Law of Fuck Yes or No also states that when you want to get involved with someone new, in whatever capacity, THEY must also respond with a “Fuck Yes” in order for you to proceed with them.”

“Wrapped up in that sweet guy who treats you so well, except goes weeks without calling you and suddenly disappears after a couple drinks and a round of the horizontal polka? Been wondering if he really likes you? Do his excuses of being so busy all the time seem legit? It doesn’t sound like the answer is a “Fuck yes.” Then it’s time to move on.”

“Fuck Yes or No applies to relationships as well. My wife used to work with a guy who got married because “it seemed like the right thing to do.”
You do your taxes because “it seems like the right thing to do.” You wipe your infant’s ass because “it seems like the right thing to do.” You don’t marry someone because “it seems like the right thing to do.” You marry them because you can’t fucking imagine ever not wanting to be with them.
Unsurprisingly, four years later, he was cheating on his wife every chance he got. The marriage was not a “Fuck Yes” for him. It should have been a “No” from Day 1.”

“Remember, it’s your job to look for something cool in everyone you meet; it’s not their job to show you. This is life, not a fucking sales convention.”

“And this is the ultimate dating advice lesson — man, woman, gay, straight, trans, furry, whatever — the only real dating advice is self-improvement. Everything else is a distraction, a futile battle in the grey area, a prolonged ego trip. Because, yes, with the right tools and performance, you may be able to con somebody into sleeping with you, dating you, even marrying you. But you will have won the battle by sacrificing the war, the war of long-term happiness.”

“Death by his hand but living by my own”

“Then she calls me and she's crying and we talk for a while about her marriage and while I am sad that my friend is sad, it makes me happier than ever that I've never been married and never will be, because marriage sounds like a goddamn job, and why would I want another one of those?”



“Premarital connection leads to extramarital relationship”

“You don’t need a master's degree to understand emotions and relations. Humanity is an innate qualification.”



“If you want to be exclusive with someone and he gives you the runaround, honor your intentions and walk away (unless your goal isn't to be with the guy but rather to write a song, screenplay, or book. If that's it--you're on the right track). Continue searching for a man who wants what you want.”



“You don't have to expect perfection of any man, but certainly expect a strong sense of "We're in this together" to know if the relationship is on solid ground.”



“It's important not to be with someone who doesn't understand your values.”

“The best thing we can bring to our marriage is willingness. We have to love our partner enough to be willing to try to make our experience together more peaceful, more honest, more courageous, more open-hearted, and more sensual. To bring our A game to the table and start taking steps to play it out. I truly believe that the skills of loving well can be learned, simply and easily—and that, in fact, they need to be learned. T”

“No generation in history has taken so seriously issues of health and well-being—both for ourselves and our children. And yet, nonetheless, we have never been lonelier. Our sense of community is breaking down, our sense of belonging has seldom felt weaker, and, silhouetted against this backdrop, couples that once loved one another have never had a more difficult time holding fast.”




“Women marry men hoping they will change. They don’t. Men marry women hoping they won’t change. They do.”



“If a wife truly demands that her emotional needs be met, she may indeed put her marriage on the line. On the other hand, few women who back away from their needs manage to bury their resentment. Their unspoken anger spills out as occasional rage and everyday coolness. Feeling uncherished, many wives unwittingly shut down their own sense of pleasure, as well as their willingness to please their partners. And even if women try to accept and forgive, eventually passion drains away from the marriage along with their authenticity. It is impossible to maintain real connection and overaccommodate at the same time.”



“Beware of men who will neither respect you nor cherish you, as a way to keep painful distance between you. They are afraid of intimacy. Superficiality is the goal of nonintimate people. Getting money and having sex are the goals of superficial couples. Sharing feelings and thoughts are the goals of truly loving, vulnerable men and women.”



“The heart gets wounded—so what? I thought. I’d seen all the plays. I should have been prepared. Love goes. But what I hadn’t known was how good the love would feel when it was there, like a hymn moving through me all the time.”



“Treat each day together like it’s your last. With that mindset, you’ll never take anyone for granted”

“Always keep your emotions under control.”

“What you communicate and how you communicate are all important to building and maintaining a healthy relationship.”

“The words you use in your communication will determine the chances of your next meeting with the person.”

“Peace begins with the satisfaction that you have enough in your life.”

“It is better to give than to receive" can be applied to MANY circumstances; relationships are not one of them. Two people should contribute to a union. When one is weak, the other is strong. It's about finding the right balance. If what you're giving outweighs what you receive, maybe the person you're with is just not the right fit for you.”



“Give people a reason to stay connected with you.”

“It's not your money that attracts real people, real people are attracted to the behaviour, values and experience you give them every time you meet.”

“It's not hate that causes breakups, it's love that causes most breakups.”

“If there is no room for argument, then find a toilet. And, flush out that argumentative person.”

“Our poverty in spirit makes us vulnerable to the IOU seduction of darkness.”
Excerpt From: Paul Renfroe. “Nobody Sees This YOU.”



“The expression of relationships stays meaningless until love becomes the fragrance of relationships.”

“(...) omdat er een dag komt, veel eerder dan je voor mogelijk houdt, dat zielsverwant een woord is dat je uit aardigheid tegen elkaar zegt en niet noodzakelijkerwijs omdat het waar is, dat er een tijd komt dat je of niemand meer hebt om naartoe te fietsen of dat je niet meer genoeg tijd hebt omdat te doen. Een dag waarop niemand meer thuis is.”



“Build great relationships with people by giving them joyful experiences so that you can live a joyful life with those great people.”

“If you don't have someone in your life who is always there for you for everything then you have lived a very crappy life.”

“Was it only age which made someone respect somebody? Were it only relationships? Surely not. It was something more than that.”



“You are blessed if you know at least one person who makes you happy every time you meet.”

“Whenever a man looks you in the eye and starts chanting "I'm not like them...", rest assured, he's a thousand worse than them.”



“Some "hello" are themselves goodbye. You hear, you see, you feel. But still... Hello, you say. Welcome. Even knowing it's going to end. Besides, endings are better than beginnings. You know the beginnings. What you don't know... I am the poet in this story, the poem is you. I'll make you up in a minute. And you will become flesh and blood again. You will come as you are, and you will go with the version in me.”



“At the end of the day, every love is doomed to end in a Mustafa Sandal song: -You're contradicting my ego, get out of here!”



“I was angry. Not because of what he did or said. For breaking my hope with what he did and said, and for making me regret once again that I left Tolga. Will I always find the same men? Will I always play the same role? As long as I don't change, maybe it would be”



“LOVE DRAW THE WEAPON AGAIN FASTER THAN ME.”

“And you, dear frog, you have neither tail nor fin...
But don't worry, you're with us!”



“Don't try to love someone whom I can't. I made myself someone to grow up in the jungle of the unlovable and still love. In order not to die. And because lovelessness kills people. An empty heart prepares its end. But don't force yourself. If I can't love someone... You can't love at all. Don't be fooled by its looks. All feral cats look cute. When you reach out your hand, you know you'll never get your arm back. And what's worse is that you left your life in their teeth.”



“Jane has been dead for more than two decades. Earlier this year I grieved for her in a way I had never grieved before. At eighty-six, I was sick and thought I was dying. Twenty and twenty-one years ago, every day of her dying for eighteen months, I stayed by her side. It was miserable that Jane should die so young, and it was redemptive that I could be with her every hour of every day. Last February I grieved again, this time that she would not sit over me as I died.”




“He was a boy breaking out and into himself at once. That's what I wanted -- not merely the body, desirable as it was, but its will to grow into the very world that rejects its hunger...as if when he came to me, his mouth wet and wanting, he came from a place on fire, a place he could never return to. And what do you do to a boy like that but turn yourself into a doorway, a place he can through again and again entering the same room?”



“To satisfy a woman, you should relax her mind before you play with her body.”

“When there was trouble, we would come towards the relationship, not move away from it—meaning we had to be willing to talk. We would live within our means. We both had to figure out a simple way to manage our lives, our time, our money—together and individually—and we had to do it without micromanaging the other.”



“Most of us, if we’re honest about it, want to be adored and held dear in our love life. We want to reach that twentieth, or thirty-second, or forty-fifth wedding anniversary and be able to say, “She’s the love of my life, and I can’t possibly imagine a day without her,” or “He’s the very best person I know, and I am so lucky to be in love with him.” We want intimacy, we want sweetness and joy, and we want a grace-filled experience of love. But look around. Who has taught us to love well? Who has given us the skills we need to help make our genuine commitment translate itself into a daily loving practice? For many of us, the answer is: no one. No one has taught us how to do this, so we must teach ourselves.”



“The Naked Date is an hour or two we set aside each week to get naked with each other. It’s a set time that allows us to take off our clothes, get in bed, and get close to each other. It might be sexual; it might not be. It is scheduled sensual time during which we set aside the pressures of daily life and get next to each other, skin to skin.”



“The Naked Date is not a time to vent about your controlling boss or discuss your child’s learning disability; it’s not the time to banter about the repairs going on in the kitchen or whether you should put your house on the market. In fact, it’s not a talking event at all. In its purest form, the Naked Date is a time to get sensual, get skin-to-skin, and be close—a time set aside for love, sex, and intimate sensuality. Does it have to be sexual every time? No. But it does need to be close.”



“The Naked Date is not a time to vent about your controlling boss or discuss your child’s learning disability; it’s not the time to banter about the repairs going on in the kitchen or whether you should put your house on the market. In fact, it’s not a talking event at all. In its purest form, the Naked Date is a time to get sensual, get skin-to-skin, and be close—a time set aside for love, sex, and intimate sensuality. Does it have to be sexual every time? No. But it does need to be close. (...) When you do this week after week, your partner will begin to feel the respect you offer him or her by your willingness to show up. He or she will know that you value your intimate time together, and that you’re willing to set aside your worries and cares and then connect. That’s a huge thing all by itself.”



“There are three aspects of a relationship that need to be attended to: my being and needs, my spouse’s needs, and the marriage’s needs. The marriage is an entity all by itself, and just like a child or a creative project, we have to feed it and nurture it. So sometimes we have to show up for it when we don’t initially feel like it.”



“We want the mastery of being able to lead our husband or wife into love. To stop thinking of passion as a hormonal experience for twenty-three-year-olds, and start living it for what it is: an adult, time-bound, mastery-seeking, exquisitely experiential ability to make our partner’s heart and senses go from zero to one hundred, over an adult timeline, just because we led him or her there. Just because we can. That’s what romance is all about. Guiding and awakening, with the expertise of all of our sensual art forms, arousing our lover to love.”



“The upshot is, if we want a happy love affair, we need to put some hours into having some romance, too. The hour or two we set aside for sensual connection with the Naked Date needs that support to help keep our arousal accessible. That means we want to plan for a bit of romance in our marriage, as well planning for our sexual time, and adapt ourselves to its nature.”

“Family life relies upon the glue between a wife and husband (or wife and wife, husband and husband in same-sex marriages.) When we start letting that glue get dry and crusty, it starts to chip away at the very foundation we’re counting on for our family life. Intimacy, plain and simple, is that glue. Going for months at a time without connecting with our partner sensually will, over time, take chunks out of the very bedrock we’re counting on to keep our family intact. Our kids rely on us to keep our love and family together, so we have to have an ethic of doing just that.”



“Our partnership is the primary bond. Not our kids. And as compelling as it is to turn our full attention to our new baby, our toddler, our young kids or our teens, if we leave our partner out in the cold, we will chip away at the very core of what holds our loving family together. We will, without doubt, put our family at risk. We have to find balance. Though it’s not always easy, with a little practice and a few simple shortcuts applied, we can realistically do it. Love is an active verb.”



“Love is an active verb. Love needs attention and practice and reverence to make it work.”

“In our relationships, we have to make the same choice: to build upon a foundation of virtue, or upon a foundation of selfishness. If we choose to base our relationships upon the foundation of a common goal to become the-best-version-of-ourselves, and understand that the best way to pursue this goal is by growing in virtue, then our relationship will likely be marked with joyfulness and contentedness. On the other hand if we choose to build our relationships on our unsteady and ever shifting whims, cravings, and self-centered desires, our relationship will more than likely be marked by an irritable, restless, and discontented spirit.”



“Spiritual intimacy is the most rewarding form of intimacy and the hardest to achieve. Once you have tasted spiritual intimacy you will discover that physical, emotional, and intellectual intimacy, while breathtaking in their own right, do not belong in the same realm as spiritual intimacy. You will also discover that as you and your partner grow in spiritual intimacy, your experience of physical, emotional, and intellectual intimacy will also be heightened. At the core of the human person is the soul, and it yearns to be fed and nurtured.”



“The same thing happens in relationships. When physical intimacy is established too quickly, we may think it is wonderful, but almost immediately it begins to stunt the growth of the relationship. We begin to overvalue physical intimacy, become preoccupied with it, and begin to judge and value our relationship on the basis of physical intimacy. As a result, we neglect the nurturing of the emotional, intellectual, and spiritual aspects of the relationship, and over time that neglect will create a distortion in its very character.”



“Intimacy is sharing the journey to become the-best-version-of-ourselves with another person. It is a mutual self-revelation that takes place gradually, cannot be rushed, and can only be realized by the commitment of time.”



“Intimacy is mutual self-revelation. It is two people constantly discovering and rediscovering each other. It is an endless process because our personalities have an endless number of layers. Conversation, shared experiences, and simply spending time together peel back these layers and reveal new and different aspects of our personalities. Intimacy is also a constant rediscovering because our preferences change, our hopes and dreams change, and as a result so does the way we want to spend our days and weeks. Intimacy takes time.”



“You may think you know just about everything there is to know about your partner, but you will be amazed at what you are missing out on if you open yourself up to taking another look. So, from time to time, it may help to approach each other as if for the first time. In this way you will experience the joy of rediscovery. Intimacy is not always about seeing new things. Sometimes it is about seeing what has always been before you, but in a different light or from a new perspective.”



“Common interests are not enough to build a great relationship on. You may enjoy hiking together or traveling together, biking together or listening to live music together. You may share a love of movies, museums, art, animals, or any number of interests that can draw people together. But it is a mistake to think that these provide a solid foundation for a long-term relationship. In fact, common interests can very often turn out to be a false foundation, creating the illusion of a deeper relationship than was actually present.”



“What keeps people together in dynamic relationships? A common purpose. Why do people break up? Because they have no sense of common purpose; or they lose sight of their common purpose; or their common purpose becomes unimportant to them. So in order to create extraordinary relationships we have to develop a common understanding of a shared purpose. But before we can understand the purpose of our relationships, we must first understand our purpose as individuals.”



“Your essential purpose is to become the-best-version-of-yourself. Plant that one idea at the center of your life. Base every decision upon your essential purpose. Make every choice with your essential purpose in mind. Place this one idea at the center of your inner dialogue and you will very quickly understand why ideas change the world. Everything makes sense in relation to our essential purpose, especially relationships.”



“You will never have a great relationship until you learn to truly appreciate the wonder of another person. And you will never experience the depths of intimacy until you grow to be thankful for the opportunity”



“There was a joy, she said, to finding that her body was adequate to get her where she was going, and it was a gift to develop a more tangible, concrete relationship to her neighbourhood and its residents.”



“If you truly want to be intimate with the people you love, you need to know what drives them. In different stages of our lives we are driven by different things; that is why it is so important to make this an annual exercise with regular review throughout the year. If you asked your spouse what his or her dreams were when you first starting dating and you haven’t spent much time on the subject since, you will likely discover that he or she has a whole new set of dreams now. If this is the case, may I suggest you ask this question of your significant other as a starting point for the renewal in your relationship: Which of your dreams got lost along the way while I was too busy pursuing my own”



“Intimacy is a risk. It should not be taken lightly, but we must take it. No man or woman can live a full life without being known by at least one person. Intimacy is a prerequisite for all those who wish to live the abundant life. The only true reason to delay the adventurous and risky pursuit of real intimacy is the absence of a confidant freely chosen and worthy of our trust.”



“Love is the wanting, and the having, and the choosing, and the becoming. Love is a desire to see the person we love be and become all he or she is capable of being and becoming. Love is a willingness to lay down our own personal plans, desires, and agenda for the good of the relationship. Love is delayed gratification, pleasure, and pain. Love is being able to live and thrive apart, but choosing to be together.”



“I fucking hate my dad."
Up until then I didn't think a white boy could hate anything about his life. I wanted to know him through and through, by that very hate. Because that's what you give anyone who sees you, I thought. You take their hatred head-on, and you cross it, like a bridge, to face them, to enter them.”



“I got what I wanted -- a boy swimming toward me. Except I was no shore, Ma. I was driftwood trying to remember what I had broken from to get here.”



“I learned the hard way that you shouldn't stay with someone because of your past together - what matters more is if you want the same things in the future.”




“My mam always used to tell me that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. And Eddie from Tesco is a fly, but he's got a taste for vinegar. It's like vinegar is all he's ever had from people, and now he doesn't even know what honey tastes like.”



“I don't know if you realise how you speak to people sometimes, the way you feed people table scraps. I know that's that what I get from you, table scraps, but because it's scraps from your table, it's better than a 3 course meal with someone else. And you've given me glimpses into your life, your real life, and I wonder if it's your fault. I wonder if you've got anything but scraps to give.”



“Go where you are celebrated - not tolerated. If they can't see your true value and worth, then it's time for a new start.”

“I believe neither in luck nor in destiny,” he declared. “I trust only the science of probabilities. I have studied mathematical statistics, combinatorial analysis, mass function, and random variables, and they have never held any surprises for me. You don’t seem fully to grasp the destabilizing effect that someone like you can have on someone like me.”



“Help that comes with a Price is no Help.”

“जिस मदद कि किमत चुकांनी पडे, वह मदद, मदद नही होती !”

“One of the striking hallmarks of individuals with psychopathy (or those at risk of developing the condition) is that their relationships seem shallow, transient, and transactional.”



“At its core, capitalism was defined by Marx as a social relation of production. He meant that profits are not the result of good accounting or the inventive ideas of the superrich, but are instead the outcome of an exploitative relationship between two classes of people: bosses and workers.”



“You cannot really be greatly turned on by something, and not be turned off by its opposite or absence.”

“Almost every husband or wife is a recycled boyfriend or girlfriend.”

“Dear Herr N.,
Nobody can set right a mismanaged life with a few words. But there is no pit you cannot climb out of provided you make the right effort at the right place.
When one is in a mess like you are, one has no right any more to worry about the idiocy of one’s own psychology, but must do the next thing with diligence and devotion and earn the goodwill of others. In every littlest thing you do in this way you will find yourself. [Everyone has] to do it the hard way, and always with the next, the littlest, and the hardest things.
Yours truly,
C.G. Jung”

“We all play and dance to the tune that's in our minds and ears. And that's what makes life enjoyable for many of us.”

“Nothing can separate true relationships not even distance”

“You wanted the horror of having me, godlike; occult.”



“And I scoop the ghost of you out of me.”



“When it comes to relationships, you must give people the space they need when they need it. Sometimes it has nothing to do with you at all.”

“To reduce, or even take away, at least temporarily, the power your crush has over you, remind yourself, when you see him or her, or his or her face, that he or she, too, defecates.”

“ke mana pun kita dibawa kehidupan, satu hal yang pasti. kau dan aku akan selalu terhubung, kau mungkin bisa mneyangkalnya, tetapi aku tidak. aku bukan pembohong yang benar - benar hebat.”



“I stop being afraid of relocations and I can move wherever I want because I know that I will be loved constantly across all space. And even if it fades with them, it will bloom again. We are all conduits. It moves through us freely.”



“Damn it, Lou!' Two hours later, Cam pounded at the steering wheel of his SUV, which was parked in my driveway. 'Stop being so dramatic. I can't second-guess every fucking word that flies out of my fucking mouth. If you pick, pick, pick at every goddamn little thing and ignore what I'm really trying to say, you're the one that's not respecting me enough to listen.”



“Do you believe in God?' 'I believe in kissing you.”



“I told myself that I was used to impermanence, that attachments would get me exactly nowhere, but then some people stay with you in ways you don't expect and you try to shake them out, shake them away, but your memory won't let you.”



“Remember: To live a happy life... Love, Eat, Travel!”



“To live a happy life... Love, Eat, Travel!”



“This might be for you to accept today: They won’t get it. Stop torturing your soul over their delusions.”

“For a happy life... Love, Eat, Travel!”



“Friendship is not necessary for closeness”



“It is ok to stop wanting the people you wanted once. Specially when you know that neither you, nor they, are still the same.”

“A family that dines together shines together.”

“Reading your note, at our table, in my voice,
I heard you were ready to accept my love,
Which, of course, changes everything.”




“Sometimes you walk away from some people only because you know in your heart they won't be happy with you.”

“If the other person has pushed through his or her discomfort to do the right thing and apologize, we can push through our discomfort and say, "Thanks for the apology." It's important to resist the temptation to cancel the effort at repair that a genuine apology is.”



“Life never gives you a chance to say goodbye so always sleep without regrets”

“I never forget those people who ever come in my life to spend some precious moments because i really appreciate and value them more than anything in this world”

“Appreciate people who are with you even after knowing you well because most people don't stay after knowing you well”

“From what I can gather," Takatsuki said after a long silence, "your wife was a wonderful woman. I am convinced of that even as I realise my knowledge of her is no more than a hundredth of yours. If nothing else, you should feel grateful for having been able to spend 20 years of your life with such a person. But the proposition that we can look into another person's heart with perfect clarity strikes me as a fool's game. I don't care how well we think we should understand them, or how much we love them. All it can do is cause us pain. Examining our own heart, however, is another matter. I think it's possible to see what's in there if you work hard enough at it. So in the end maybe that's the challenge: to look inside your own heart as perceptively & seriously as you can, & to make peace with what you find there. If we hope to truly see another person, we have to start by looking within ourselves.”



“False commitment can ruin your reputation forever”

“You might be thinking: Okay, great. I definitely have problems in my life and relationships, but how do I overcome them? Where do I even start?
When you encounter challenges, adversity, or conflict, you must engage your core.
I’m a lifelong athlete. Every sport I train for has one common need: a strong core. It helps prevent injuries. It gives you stability that makes you less likely to fall over, and it makes it easier to get back up when you do.
Thoughtfully Fit also has a core that is central to everything you do in the model. It always comes back to control and choices: What do you control? What are your choices?
For example, you can’t control what other people do, but you can control your thoughts and actions. You may not be able to control angry customers, the effects of a global pandemic, the results of a presidential election, or decisions coworkers make, but you do control how you respond. And you always have choices in how you respond.”



“الاحترام أجعله للجميع، والحب أجعله لمن يبادلك ذلك الحب، أما العشق ففي جميع الأحوال سيرغمك على أن تجعله لشخص واحد فقط. فالعشق هو طاقة هائلة من الحب تأتي دون سابق إنذار.. بمجرد أن تبصر توأم روحك ستجد نفسك منجذب إليه وتحبه بجنون دون أية أسباب.. ستتيقن أن كل ما مررت به من علاقات عاطفية لم تكن سوى بدافع الإعجاب.. ستدرك حينذاك معنى العشق.. ستدرك أن كل تلك القصص الرومانسية الخيالية التي كنت تشاهدها بالأفلام وتقرأها في الروايات كانت أيضاً من تربة الواقع.. تعاش كل يوم وكل ثانية.. المؤلم هو أن ليس جميعها محكوم عليها بالنجاح.. فرغم قوة العشق الهائلة إلا أن في بعض الأحيان قد تقهره الظروف..قد يقهره الواقع.. الخيال هو أن نحلم بنجاح كل تلك القصص الرومانسية المزخرفة بالعشق الأبدي.. فرغم أبدية العشق وقوته إلا أن الروايات والأشاعر ذات نفسها تعترف بالواقع وتعمل به أحياناً.. أحياناً نحتاج إلى الخيال لنسقي جذور أرواحنا بالأمل.. ولكننا في النهاية نعود إلى الواقع مرغمين.. من ينتصر هو من يحول أكبر جزء ممكن من أحلامه وخياله إلى الواقع الذي يعيشه كل يوم.. ومن يفشل هو من يظل هائماً بين أحلامه وخيالاته أثناء نوم جسده الذي يثقله الكسل دائماً على المهد دون محاولة تحويل تلك الأحلام والخيالات إلى الواقع الذي يعيشه والسعي إلى ذلك.. فالفرق الواهي بين أحلام النوم والأحلام التي خلقت لتصبح واقعاً هو عقلية الحالم ورغبته في العمل بدلا من النوم.”



“الوطن ناس قبل المكان.”



“خطة الله دائماً مثالية حتى في تلك الأوقات عندما تكون بصيرتنا عمياء من إبصار المثالية! لذا أدركت أنها مشيئة الله وأنه لا يوجد أعظم وأحكم من مشيئة الله وقدره! فدائماً ما يشغل بال الإنسان هو كيفية أن يصبح مثالياً ويجعل قدره مثالياً.. الحياة مثل الفيلم السينمائي الذي انتهى تصويره بالنسبة لله وما زال جارياً بالنسبة للإنسان. فالله يعلم ويحدد ما سيحدث وأعطانا علامات عليه وساعدنا على تجاوزه. ولكن نحن من نحدد طريقة تعاملنا مع ما سيحدث. على سبيل المثال، الإنسان لا يختار أن يولد مكفوفاً ولكنه يختار كيف يتعامل مع الأمر ويتعايش معه.. لا يختار عائلته ولكنه يختار كيف يحبها ويحميها ويدافع عنها.. لا يختار وطنه ولكنه يختار كيف يحبه ويخلص له.. ولا حتى يختار اسمه ولكنه يختار كيف يجعل لهذا الاسم قيمة أو يشوهه. لذا صحيح أن الله هو الذي يختار الطريق الذي سيسلكه الإنسان. ولكن الإنسان هو المسئول عن طريقة حدوث قدره.. فهو مسئول من الله عن خطواته وليس طريقه. فالإنسان مخير بالنسبة لنفسه ومسير بالنسبة لله لأن ببساطة الزمن يعد شيئاً خلقه الله ولا يمكن تطبيق شيء مخلوق على خالقه ذات نفسه! فالله خلق الزمن لكي نتمكن نحن البشر من معرفة البداية من النهاية.. البارحة من الغد! ومع ذلك، رغم الأهمية الكبيرة للزمن إلا أنه ليس سوى مخلوق سينتهي مع نهاية مخلوق آخر وهو الكون! قد تظهر أقدارنا أحيانا غير مثالية. ولكن الحقيقة هى أن مثاليتها تكمن في عدم مثاليتها أحياناً! فبشكل عام، أحيانا المثالية تكمن في عدم المثالية. فالله يوازن بين أقدارنا في الدنيا وأقدارنا في الآخرة.. عقابنا في الدنيا وعقابنا في الآخرة.. مكافأتنا في الدنيا ومكافأتنا في الآخرة. فهو يحاول دائماً أن يساعدنا على تحقيق أفضل نتيجة وهو دخول جنته! ولكننا نحن البشر غالباً ما نرفض هديته! فنحن دائماً نفكر بمنظور واحد وهو قدرنا في الحياة ولا نفكر بمنظور قدرنا في الآخرة! لذا كلما مر الإنسان بظروف ومواقف عصيبة وفعل الكثير من الأعمال العظيمة كلما زادت فرصته في الدخول إلى الجنة لأن الظروف العصيبة هى الوسيلة التي عن طريقها يأخذ الله من سيئاتنا ويختبر إيماننا. وقد يظفر الإنسان بحسنات أيضاً بدلاً من السيئات إن نجح في اجتياز تلك الظروف العصيبة بتفوق. وذلك يكون بالصبر والإيمان الصلب.. في النهاية، نستنتج من كل هذا الأمر أشبه بعملية الإتزان التي نجدها في كل شيء. فقد نجدها بين المواد في التفاعلات الكيميائية.. أو قوانين الفيزياء.. أو بين أقدارنا في الدنيا وأقدارنا في الآخرة.. أو أيضاً فيما بيننا.. فنحن البشر نكمل بعضنا البعض.. نصلح بعضنا البعض.. ثم نصبح أقرب إلى الكمال بفضل اتحادنا معاً. فالعلاقات بين البشر مثل المجال المغناطيسي.. السالب يلتقي بالموجب والموجب يلتقي بالسالب.. لا يوجد أحد مطابق لأحد.. فكل إنسان هو عملة مستقلة بذاتها.. قد تتشابه بعض العملات ولكنها لا تتساوى أبداً.. ورغم ذلك قيمة هذه العملات تكمن في أنها قابلة للالتصاق والاتحاد لتصبح أكبر قيمة ممكنة.. هكذا نحن البشر بإمكاننا أن نقترب من الكمال.”



“إنه تلك التقاطعات التي تحدث بين أقدارنا لتكمل بعضها البعض كأنها مفترقات طرق تكمل الطرق! فهكذا يخلق الله أقدارنا بذات الوقت وبذات الإحكام! فجزء كبير من حياة كل إنسان هو ليس سوى عبارة عن أجزاء صغيرة من حياوات أناس آخرين عديدين شاركهم حياواتهم وشاركوه حياته! حقاً يا له من أمر عجيب ومحكم البناء!”



“A wise man has no family.”

“When you have a choice, take your time and make the right choice because if you make the wrong choice, you will have no choice.”

“The story begins with your actions.”

“Though I prided myself on tender sensitivity, I have never known when a great love affair was beginning. Some barricade lies midway my mind, and I'm usually on my back scrutinising a ceiling before it is borne in on me that this is the man I fantasised in my late-night fingering.”



“He is not curious about my work, I am not curious about his. I’m general, we stopped asking each other how we were, what we thought, and what we wanted a long time ago. We stopped being curious about each other, period. You cannot spend your life with someone without curiosity. It is as devastating as infidelity, yet somehow working in a slower, gentler, more insidious way. It is being unfaithful to your own life”

“my generation is filled
with lovers who will never know
the true meaning of love
relationships that feel more
like a prison term
and a happiness
that is simply a delusion
my generation, filled with chaos
no peace, it’s difficult, it’s complicated
it’s nothing, it hurts, it gets worse”



“the clouds dance around each other
like lovers avoiding the truth”



“I love the sound of NOT hearing from some people.”

“And this was why lapses of judgement broke me. Because not knowing what it was like to kiss Luca didn’t hurt. But kissing him, feeling all those new emotions, then having to tear myself away from him? That took something from me.”




“It's very challenging to live life as a weird personality”

“It's great to be weird, 99.99% of people don't understand you and 00.01% of people you don't want to understand”

“If you can feed an animal it is always beyond feeding humans”

“Humans can leave you after having dinner with you, not animals”

“What if we run into them?” I ask. Her eyes meet mine in the mirror and she gives me a small shrug.
“You know seeing you has to hurt them too.” She sets the iron down and runs her fingers through my hair. “Elle must be torn up about what she did.” I open my mouth to argue, but Rosie shakes her head. “She’s not a monster. She might be a terrible friend, but we both know somewhere in there she has a heart.”
With Rosie and me being so near in age, she was almost as close to Elle as I was. Elle had even encouraged Rosie to try out for the junior varsity cheer squad, and would help her with the routines—something that the previous varsity cheer captain wouldn’t have dreamed of doing.”

“She leans against the doorway and I can see how tired she is. Yet even with everything she has on her plate, she’s been there for me through all of this. I smile at her and then at my sister, feeling truly grateful to have such an amazing support group.”

“Sometimes time is all we need to make everything right”

“You can't make good relationships with bad intentions”

“Never use people for your temporary pleasure”

“When someone takes advantage of you and uses you badly for something, you will understand why you have lost those precious relationships in your life”

“Building relationships is the easiest thing in the world but keeping those relationships healthy and alive is the most challenging thing on this planet”

“Một mối quan hệ đặc biệt khiến người ta thoải mái, không phải là những đoạn đối thoại anh một câu, tôi một câu, mà chính là những khoảnh khắc bất chợt, tôi có thể nói bất cứ điều gì mà tôi nhìn thấy, bất cứ hình ảnh nào chạy qua trong đầu của tôi với bạn, không cần phải tìm kiếm những từ ngữ thích hợp, lải nhải nguyên một bài không đâu vào đâu cũng không phải lo sợ mình có nói điều gì không nên nói hay không, gửi tin nhắn đi không cần phải thấp thỏm chờ đợi hồi âm, bởi tôi biết nhất định bạn sẽ đọc được. Đó chính là tín nhiệm, là sự tin tưởng, là cảm giác yên tâm rằng mình sẽ không bao giờ bị bỏ rơi.”



“You’re afraid all of that will stop again if things don’t work out with someone new?” I let go of the string and look up into her eyes. She leans in, hugging her knees a little to close some distance.
“It was just so hard to find the energy to get back into everything after he broke up with me. It just felt hopeless.”
“Grief is normal. A lot of people sense a feeling of hopelessness when they experience a loss. You experienced a low, but you didn’t get stuck there. You’ve grown and put some good effort into rebuilding your life.” Her words put weight behind what I have been doing lately. I’ve learned it takes a lot of pieces to put a life back together, and I don’t ever want my world to revolve around anyone else again.”

“How deeply and unknowingly we are all connected. Life knows us all and plays with our interconnectedness.”




“Love is irrational on all levels except one.”

“Although family dinners can be a good way for people to connect, they can also be the reason for a great deal of heartburn.”



“So much of sexual desire comes from the belief that another body can alleviate our aloneness. It can’t do that, but people believe it can. When one body doesn’t work, they look for another. When we don't feel alone, we don't look for anyone’s body or personality to fill the void. There is no void.”



“The most important love is not for the Divine. The Divine is inevitable, inescapable. It doesn’t need love; it is love – in all its tiny, grand, whispering, explosive, destructive, birthing ways. The most important love is for people. They are what we must keep. ”

“It's a blessing to have someone who understands that your anger comes from the pain in your heart.”

“Healing is a process not an overnight journey, give yourself time to recover from scary experiences and situations”

“You can't hold on to things just because of the memories. Otherwise, no one would ever move house. Or country. Or chuck a crap boyfriend. Every crap boyfriend has at least one good memory attached to him. But you have to let them go. Otherwise, you're all, 'Oh, but there was that lovely time we walked in the autumn leaves.”



“Most of the time, however, our past patterns point us to some deficits or injuries in our own character makeup. These deficits don't go away unless we enter the process of personal growth.”

“He was old enough now to know that within every relationship was something unfulfilled and disappointing, something that had to be sought elsewhere.”

“The people who can easily show their feelings are the people who have suffered less in their life”

“People who once blocked me on WhatsApp are permanently removed from my life”

“Bad company is always bad company”

“18 to 25 is not the only age when you find temporary people in your life, experiencing temporary people is an ongoing process, it all depends on how much you want to have them in your life”

“I love how Victor Hamilton puts it: '[Kenegdo] suggests that what God creates for Adam will correspond to him. Thus the new creation will be neither a superior nor an inferior, but an equal. The creation of this helper will form one-half of a polarity and will be to man as the South Pole is to the North Pole.' She will be his strongest ally in pursuing God's purposes and his first roadblock when he veers off course.”




“Instead of an unstoppable force for good and justice in the world and a deadly threat to the Enemy, male-female relationships have been dismantled of power.”



“Last night, I felt a depth of sadness that I haven't felt or allowed myself to feel in a while. I mourned for Mia, the loss of our friendship, and mostly for the loss of my history, the lost memory of who I once was.”

“You have the choice to be with someone who is good to you and move away from someone who is bad to you. But if someone is good and bad both, you lose choice; you become confused and they pull your strings.”

“Living alongside each other, not with each other.”



“You dance with the person you went to the party with.”



“There is something romantic about the thought of all the apartments that aren’t for sale.”



“God didn't create the woman to bring half of herself to his global commission or to minimize herself when the man is around. The fanfare over her is overblown if God was only planning for her to do for the man things he was perfectly capable of doing for himself or didn't even need... If Adam must think, decide, protect, and provide for the woman, she actually becomes a burden on him--not much help when you think about it. The kind of help the man needs demands full deployment of her strength, her gifts, and the best she has to offer. His life will change for the better because of what she contributes to his life.”



“Paul tells the bride in Ephesians 6:10-12 that her enemies are 'not...flesh and blood,' but the unseen spiritual forces of evil and darkness. She is called to arm herself for battle, to 'be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power,' and to 'stand firm'--all of which convery 'unflinching courage like that possessed by soldiers who determinedly refuse to leave their posts irrespective of how severely the battle rages.'
Both brides represent an unmistakable call to action. They give us powerful feminine images of strong, open-throttled living for God's kingdom, which makes it difficult to imagine that God wants his daughters to sit on the sidelines while our brothers do kingdom work without us.”



“God's tactics are counterintuitive to our male-centered world, but therein lies the surprise for the Enemy, for the world, and for us. For when men and women are allied together, richer discussions result in better decisions, the elimination of blind spots, and a greater kingdom force in the world. If you don't believe me, just compare Esther, Mordecai, Mary, and Joseph each operating solo with what they accomplished by working together.”



“Not passion but compassion.
Com—means "with."
What kind of withness would that be?”



“Rich, collaborative, interdependent relationships between God's sons and daughters are vital to both genders and make the body of Christ stronger. The Blessed Alliance fuels the kingdom of God and must not be displaced by an atmosphere of tension, fear, and mistrust.”



“This debate has repercussions on how we live for God, how we relate to our neighbors both near and far, and how we connect with our Christian brothers. It affects the valuing of women, the quality of our marriages, and the teachings and behavioral patterns we pass on to our children. It shapes our ideas of what it means to be part of the body of Christ, how we develop and use our gifts, and what Jesus asks of us in fulfilling his mission for the world.”



“Jesus told his disciples, 'I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth' (Matthew 28:18). He confers a derived authority on his male and female image bearers as his coregents--not to rule over each other, but to rule the earth to ensure both welfare and flourishing.
Equality is a foundational truth that extends to every human being and is rooted firmly in our image-bearer identity. The Bible doesn't nuance or debate equality, but sets it in stone. Equality distinguishes the kingdom of God from kingdoms of this world that rank, rate, discriminate, and privilege some human beings over others. No second class rating, no marginalization, oppression, or mistreatment can alter this rock solid truth, for it is grounded in our unchanging God.
Both concepts were distorted by the fall, along with everything else. God's image bearers turned authority and ruling on one another instead of jointly pursuing God's glory for the benefit of all creation. Equality went missing from human relationships as the human race plunged into self-seeking, murder, violence, power, and oppression. Evidence of how far the human race has fallen is rampant in the appalling oppression and violence perpetrated against women throughout the world.
The New Testament restores authority and equality in the teachings of Jesus and the writings of Paul in ways that are truly 'not of this world.' Jesus did not come to affirm or make slight alterations to the world's way of doing things. He came to rebuild both load-bearing walls--to reconnect a lost and fallen humanity to our Creator and to reestablish the Blessed Alliance between men and women. His construction methods take us down a different, countercultural path.”



“No tactic of the Enemy and no entrenched blindness on our part have the power to deter God from seeing his vision for us to completion. God's secret plan has now been revealed to us; it is a plan centered on Christ, designed long ago according to his good pleasure. 'And this is his plan: At the right time he will bring everything together under the authority of Christ--everyting in heaven and on earth' (Ephesians 1:10)--including his sons and daughters.”



“By exerting ourselves through unnecessary or irrelevant speech or action, we increase the risk of conflict by a million percent.
By meeting or approaching when it is not necessary or relevant to do so, we increase the risk of increasing the risk by a million percent.
Space cultivates longing, (so) may longing cultivate space. And thus cultivate warmth and peace, enforced by brief interactions [parting ways on positive notes]. Space can be expressed not only in the physical sense.”

“Actually, what he had done is come out of his cave looking for a woman, got his bat out, walked into the first place that had women, and hit the prettiest over the head with a bat and dragged her out kicking and screaming. A Neanderthal man! Nikita thought,”



“You shouldn't have to convince anyone to choose you. There is no real choice in love."
He settles back in his seat, and I stay frozen, the stem of the glass still between my fingertips.
"It shouldn't just be people he chooses you over. But himself as well.”



“Work for peace. Think before you say something. Are you making things better or just taking out your trash.
The point is growth. Constant process of reclamation. Clearing out the deadwood and making room for things to grow.”

“Once upon a time there is nothing but darkness. You stumble around blindly, so close to the edge that you are sure you'll tumble over it. And if you are to be honest, you must admit that you are so low already you don't necessarily think that would be a bad thing. Then one day you meet someone. He finds you kneeling right at the precipice and instead of telling you to get back up he kneels next to you. He tries to see what you are seeing. He doesn't ask anything of you or beg you to snap out of it or remind you there are people who need you. He just waits until you turn and squint and think to yourself, "oh yes, I remember, this is what light looks like." You don't know how it happens, but you become friends. You find yourself looking in the parking lot to see if his car is there. You see something on tv or read it in a book and think, "I must remember to tell him." You learn how he takes his coffee and what his favorite color is, not by asking but by observation. Then you realize your day speeds up when you see him. The hair stands up on the backs of your forearms when his shoulder bumps yours in the elevator. His presence is so filling the absence of him aches. You begin to reconfigure the puzzle of your life with him in it. You don't want to spend time without him if you can help it. You introduce him to family. You suffer their elbow gabs and raised eyebrows, because later it gives you two something to laugh about. You wish you could introduce him to the family members who aren't here anymore. They would have loved him. You see him around children and you think one day.”



“We don't realize our strength until we have to be strong to save someone we love.”

“I gaze at his unshaven face; it's manly. He's handsome in an old-fashioned kind of way, straight out of a 1950s movie”

“When I was little, my mother used to tell me that a woman becomes invisible to men at a certain age.
Perhaps that's why she let him commit the acts that he did. She would become visible only then, once she'd served a purpose in his agenda, and she knew the secret would forever bind him to her.”

“Status. That word just rolls off her tongue. She makes no excuses for her snobbish arrogance.”



“Last night, I felt a depth of sadness that I haven't felt or allowed myself to feel in a while. I mourned for Mia, the loss of our friendship, and mostly for the loss of my history, the lost memory of who I once was.”



“But I do belong here," he said, wrapping his arms around her.
"Yes," Esha laughed and Kunal reveled in the fact that it was for him, that her laughs would be his gift for the rest of his life.”



“There is no correlation between how much money was spent on the wedding and how long the marriage is going to last.”

“Maybe it's what we've been through, or maybe we really are broken in the same way, our jagged edges aligning perfectly.”



“When I needed the comfort of your presence. All that you gave me was this loneliness.”

“Some relations don't give you anything. They take away everything that you have got.”

“Alone. Is anyone listening? Without prejudice, without motive, without preaching, without judgement, without bullying, without ego. With heart alone.”

“Married life will become a hell if it is not based on love, trust & mutual respect.”




“Never expose your spouse”



“I know I will never be enough for you.”

“Disrespect prevents love from growing.”

“i've been going to bed with a woman who despised me”

“At least poppy never boared you. Half the marriages i know are temple to boredom”

“I wonder how much of our humanity as individuals is compromised by the absence of the humanity of those around us who are themselves compromised by our absence?”

“Without jealousy, the flame of love will be extinguished.”

“Getting religion does not get rid of the erections that are brought about by females to whom the man is not married.”

“The mirror and I are having an insane talk.
That's what they call you for escaping.
And you will happily accept this label
because it is always opposite day with the narcissist.”



“It's like, if you listen carefully to what other people are saying, you can really understand what they're trying to say, you know what I mean?”



“Nothing good lasts...Don't trust anyone who claims otherwise.”



“Don't wait to lose a person to realize their worth in your life.”

“It's not just about sharing happy moments. It's about surviving the tough times together.”

“You may need to have difficult conversations with your partner about what you need to get a good night's sleep. This may include sleeping in different rooms if snoring or tossing and turning is waking you up. It may also include agreements not to argue or discuss difficult topics before bedtime. You should also talk about sex and try to agree on what time of day is best for both of you to get more sleep—this doesn’t sound that romantic but for a healthy, stable relationship, it’s incredibly important.”



“You can never grow by putting others down.”

“You always need two people to save a relation.”

“It is easy to ask someone to change but difficult to change yourself for someone.”

“Value people who understand the soft intentions behind your harsh words.”

“The Key to Peace: Stop blaming each other. Do better next time.”

“In Genesis God is multiplying the mystery of the Trinity in his image bearers by creating another individual who stands on level ground with the man and is completely different from, yet one with him. The oxygen hasn't grown thin after all. God is still vision casting--this time for male/female relationships.”



“Focus on the wife as her husband's helper has led to the belief that God gave primary roles and responsibilities to men, and secondary, supporting roles to women. It has led to practices that communicate that women are second class citizens at home and in the church. None of this is true. There is nothing second class about God's vision for his daughters, and the ezer holds the clues.”



“Unfortunately, I was realizing more and more that to understand my own privilege was to know the misfortune of others.”




“I felt a powerful compulsion to reach out and touch her, as though her body was a familiar place—as though she’s someone I’d known all my life, someone I was relieved to see again.”



“Half the chocolate bar was stuffed in my mouth when it dawned on me: I was totally going to break out from crushing that hard.”



“It was a dangerous thing for me to know what I wanted.”



“Even now after all he’s done, I’m still waiting for his attention.”



“That is how it was with them. A closeness, a rapport that was almost entire, except for these small niggling uncertainties which, most of the time, she [Janey Ashcroft] was able to ignore, but sometimes, like tonight, grew like balloons to such size and importance that she wondered how she was going to be able to cope with them.
['Anniversary']”



“It can't just be about the other person. You have to be someone, too. You have to know who you are.”



“I think so much of making a relationship work has to do with choosing to be kind even when you may not feel like it. It sounds like the most obvious thing in the world but it's much easier said than done, don't you think?”



“Walking out of a weak relation will always make you strong.”

“I have learnt to take care of myself without you.”

“I have an idea. Next time, when you’re randomly freaking out about, you know, the world rotating and stuff, what we do is we come here, and we climb on this pendulum thing. And problem solved . . . we’ll be the only two people on the planet who are standing still while everyone else is turning.”



“It was a strange sensation, the thawing of a frozen heart.”



“What do I feel? Like a large winged creature dropped you into my life but forgot to leave the operating manual.”



“It was intimate . . . a strange and beautiful feeling. We were breathing life into each other.”



“But you have to push back against the fear and the only way to do that is by arming yourself with knowledge and practice. Why? Because when it’s all over, even if you die and are rotting in the ground, at least you’ll know you didn’t leave quietly.”



“There are two types of pain in this world, one hurts and the other alters.”

“We annihilate convention in order to experience the truth of otherness.”



“... we are facing each other. But you look at me and I look away from me. You look in and I look out.”



“In the universe of her thoughts, the rarest, purest fear is that possibly she sees not him through the well, but her own reflection and the sky behind her silhouette. Her mind does not voice this thought, it has no language for the horror.”



“Rotten eggs that will never hatch”



“My parents. They’ve been married thirty years, but my father still discovers things about my mother that shock him.’ ‘Really,’ Thora drawls. ‘Does your mum say the same thing about your dad?’ He looks confused, then wary. ‘Why?’ ‘Because that’s a classic thing men say when they don’t want to engage with women as people. Oh, she’s such a mystery, when she’s been telling you for the past thirty years what she wants and you just haven’t been listening.”



“I mean, they only know each other as husband and wife. They might say things, do things, with their friends, even with you, that they’d never show to each other.’ He shrugs. ‘You can’t ever know someone completely. You’d have to be everything to them, and that’s impossible.”



“Noemi wondered if High Place had robbed her of her illusions, or if they were meant to be shattered all along. Marriage could hardly be like the passionate romances one read about in books. It seemed to her, in fact, a rotten deal. Men would be solicitous and well behaved when they courted a woman, asking her out to parties and sending her flowers, but once they married. the flowers wilted. You didn't have married men posting love letters to their wives. That's why Noemí tended to cycle through admirers. She worried a man would be briefly impressed with her luster, only to lose interest later on. There was also the excitement of the chase, the delight that flew through her veins when she knew a suitor was bewitched with her. Besides, boys her age were dull, always talking about the parties they had been to the previous week or the one they were planning to go to the week after. Easy, shallow men. Yet the thought of anyone more substantial made her nervous, for she was trapped between competing de sires, a desire for a more meaningful connection and the desire to never change. She wished for eternal youth and endless merriment.”



“You feel insecure in a relationship only when you feel unloved and unheard.”

“I don't know what would I do without you.”

“You can’t tell someone to trust you. Rather, you have to show them that you can be trusted. And when we hear a whole lot of ‘telling’ but see very little ‘showing,’ we can be assured that there’s a whole lot of ‘nothing’ to trust.”

“Sometimes putting your best foot forward is a misstep. Sometimes you are stepping into the feculence of a mongrel. Be careful who you give your best efforts to.”



“Playfulness and Passion… Friendship and Intimacy… I want a relationship with a good flirt to roast ratio.”

“My only regret is that you never fought to keep me in your life.”

“A year. They had known each other a year. They [Janey and David] had this closeness, this rapport. But the final certainty was missing, and it was this void that, because she loved him so much, she was learning to live with.
['Anniversary']”



“True luxury isn’t material, it’s about people”




“Love after a time of loss can be a beautiful thing: it brings a new perspective, it decreases loneliness and increases companionship, and, for these reasons, it increases holistic wealth.”



“All I really know is that nothing I've experienced so far compares to you. Maybe that makes me gay . . . or maybe that just makes me yours.”



“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show youserlf to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their responde is "You're safe with me" - that's intimacy.”



“किसी के लिए अपने आप को बदल लेना हमेशा बुरी बात नहीं होती।”

“Worry about yourself; Your own behaviour. Regulating that and trying to be the best person you can be. Instead of focusing on what others are or are not doing for you. You will be a lot happier.”

“...to understand and explore interpersonal relationships, we must do so in the context of our relationship with God. We were made by Him and for Him. The root of all conflict is our departure from God, and the resolution of all conflict must build from peace with God.”



“If and when they change, I will change my opinion about them."
No. If you want them to change, first you have to soften your opinions about them.”

“Being too forgiving to everyone is only going to hurt you.”

“You see, time and circumstance are everything. You can’t stop what is meant to happen, and you can’t force what isn’t fated to occur.”

“Log acche ya bure nahi hote, accha ya bura toh waqt hota hai.”

“Money is associated with numbers, but the numbers themselves are not. Even gold is still money.”

“Gold was considered real money, before your paper money existed.”

“Paper money cheats, the real value lies in owning gold.”

“If you want to invest, go for gold. Turn all the cash into gold, that's the only way out.”

“Karmic groupings are never by accident. People congregate together, flying in like a flock of birds and eventually out again. There may be some years difference in timing, but years are neither here nor there in the timeless eternal.”



“The loneliness I feel when I am alone is better than the sadness I feel when I am with you.”

“There's a loser in every relationship. We may not like to admit it, but one of us always gets a little more and one of us always gives up a little more readily.”



“...it is no great task to remember people--the challenge is in forgetting them and allowing one's self to -go on-.
[Édouard Manet]”



“It wasn't that he made her feel incompetent and unsure of herself and her tastes. It was the reverse. He knew nothing about anything, and she'd never really allowed herself to notice it until now.”



“People say that, No Sorry and No Thanks is needed in relationship, But Reality is that these two words actually save the Relation!”

“Feelings' change with 'Time', Good or Bad, none of them are permanent.”

“Kuch rishton ka aaj bhi NAAM nahi hota.. Kuch jo saalo pehle baney ho, ya kuch jo shaayad roz bante hai.. Lekin bohot gehere...”

“Health gives satisfaction, but not so much with pleasure in the sense of indulging oneself.”

“To some people, wealth give them happiness too; but satisfaction is where the issue lies.”

“If you take away the big words and the solemn face, there is still plenty left, so there is no need to be scared.”



“If I just think about it a bit more, if I really dwell on this and maybe put some sad music on then somehow I’ll get to solve something on my own that actually involves two people.”

“Holding onto somebody can seem more important than if we should be holding onto them at all”

“You've affected my life in ways you'll never know.”

“A relation which is dependent on one person's efforts is not a relation. It's a compromise.”

“we smiled
we kissed
as the trees
whispered secrets
of our love”




“Everything I am, I've made myself. Maybe you have all shaped me, molded me like a vase, but when all is said and done, when everyone has chipped away their pieces, I will not break.”



“When it comes to finding a life partner, we become so impatient, hasty and highly impulsive with no willingness to be put on hold. As we presently ponder on the absence of Mr Right, we easily conclude that there's no one and there won't be anyone.”



“Relationships change and the past isn’t some static thing you could keep forever like a photograph. No one else seems to understand that. Just because something happened, it doesn’t mean it will mean the same thing to you forever. It changes with you.”



“Nothing is as safe as hating that which God hates; you can never go wrong... For what He'll grant will be what He loves. So, if God hates it, hate it also. If He loves it, love it more.”



“Intellectual women have less time to please men. They care about the beautiful mind rather than the bodily appetite.”

“There is something indescribably important about having that one person in your life who you absolutely bond with. You have an understanding of who they are and they have an understanding of who you are in a way that no-one can match. They are capable of providing a reality check, and just simply being non-negotiably
there
. There really is no substitute and if there's one thing I would wish for younger people that would upgrade the quality of their lives and make them more secure and more capable it would be that they find a person with whom they can build such a relationship, and build it.”

“Every time we fall in love
we fall even more apart.”

“Tôi nhận ra trong suốt những năm tháng đã đi qua đời mình, cảm giác về sự yên ổn và hạnh phúc trong tôi rất ngắn ngủi và mong manh. Nó hệt như hoa nở có mùa và trăng không mãi sáng trên bầu trời. Tôi là một con người cô đơn, không bao giờ tin mình hạnh phúc, nên chỉ cần hạnh phúc muốn rời xa là tôi lập tức buông tay. Tôi nhìn hạnh phúc của tôi bỏ tôi đi, lòng đầy bão giông mà không một lần níu lại.”



“Some people are irreplaceable! Like, the things they do for you and the feelings they had and showed you … You may never experience it again. So be thankful!”

“There are times that you talk to someone for days, weeks, months and years, but the don't mean much. Then you find someone that you spend a little time with and they leave a legacy and a desire...”

“No. The worst thing happened to me long ago and my life has been awful since that day. You are not going to leave me are you?'
I laughed, 'of course not.'...
'I do not know what I would do if you left me... I have been alone for so long I do not think I would be able to live if I had to be alone again”

“Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
... On the other hand, ain't nothin' but massive solar storms when she's present.”

“There's danger in not learning from the past. There's more danger in not leaning on God too... Mr Right does exist, but not how the world has portrayed him, not how we've imagined him to be.”



“The only trick, like that of Genesis, is to allow God to be the one who gives, and not to wish to get it for ourselves. Then the outside appearance would not matter that much, but what is instilled within the character would be our greatest concern.”



“A vigilant eye is a necessity. Look before listening, listen before you act, and act when you've reasoned. There's nothing such as falling in love; falling is a mistake. But a person who has reasoned and consulted with God chooses to love.”



“Deception is dangerous, but, even worse, if it comes from self. We're all vulnerable until Christ becomes our guard and trust, then we wait upon Him. We're not as good as we think; let Christ be the one who sees the need, lest our faith be shipwrecked.”



“What power a girl can have over a boy, to make him write such things! And what power a boy can have over a girl, to make her believe he has seen her fate. We don't know the effects we have on each other, but we have them.”



“When you are broken hearted from a man who tells you, "you knew who I was from day one", he's right.”

“People can be tricky when they're trying to get something from you. Especially if that something is love.”



“There is a thin line between loneliness and solitude …. Those who understand how delicious unlonely tastes they stop looking for unappetizing company.”

“I think people that are too similar... they don’t mix well. Are used to think soulmates were two of the same. Are used to think I was supposed to look for somebody that was just like me.
I don’t believe in soulmates anymore and I’m not looking for anything. But if I did believe in them, I believe your soulmate with somebody who had all the things you didn’t, that needed all the things you had. Not somebody who’s suffering from the same stuff you are.”



“What went on in that head of his? I would soon come to understand that he gave voice to only a fraction of the thoughts that swam behind his eyes. It was not nearly so clean and smooth in there as it seemed. Other lives were housed in that mind, parallel worlds. Maybe we’re all built a little bit that way. But most of us drop hints. Most of us leave clues. My father was more careful.
When I think now of that moment in the kitchen, an almost unbelievable thought comes to my mind: There was a time when those two people - that man hunched at the table and that woman shouting in a bathrobe - were young. The proof was in the pictures that hung on the living room walls, a pretty girl and a bookish guy, a studio apartment in a crumbling Hollywood building overlooking a courtyard and a kidney-shaped pool. This was the mythical period before I was born, when my mother was not a mother and was instead an actress who might make it someday/. How much sweeter life would be if it all happened in reverse, if, after decades of disappointment, you finally arrived at an age when you had conceded nothing, when everything was possible. I like to think about how my parents’ lives once shimmered in front of them, half hidden, like buried gold. Back then the future was whatever they imagined - and they never imagined this.”



“A pencil doesn't know what to write. A paper doesn't know what to be written. But if they both are surrendered to the writer (God), something beautiful gets written through them.”

“If the relationship is full of expectation and exploitation, it would end up with expulsion and further leads to evacuation from social connections.”

“You can always earn more money but your Time and Relationships won't come back. Make an effort to enhance Relationships, because that's the key to your happiness.”

“The wiser we become, the more we do our best to keep a great distance between ourselves and love.”

“Love is the lowest of human desires, therefore it is more attracted to the humble than to the intelligent man.”

“Somebody imperfect to the world can be absolutely perfect for you.”

“A question I ask myself everyday. Do I have the right to care for you?”

“The woman's body twitched suddenly, as if remembering something, and she covered her mouth with a stiff mitten. Dara knew what it was. She'd felt it a dozen times that day already. The body remembering, contorting, -He's gone, he's gone.-
For a moment, only a moment, Dara felt sorry for her.
As if sensing it, the woman looked at her and reached for her sunglasses, removing them at last. Her eyes heavy, swollen.
'I wish I could explain,' she said. 'You build this family. And it's perfect. It's everything you wanted. And then something goes wrong. Slowly or all at once. It was good and now it's bad, and it's his fault. Or he started it. All the ripples from his bad behavior.'
Dara didn't say anything. The woman kept going.
'So, in some private part of your head, you start thinking up fantasies of escape. You tell yourself: If only he were gone, if only a heart attack, a lightning bolt, a car crash...'
'I have to go,' Dara said, turning.
'Sometimes,' the woman said suddenly, her voice choked. 'Sometimes, you think you'd do anything to get out to be free.'
They held glances a long moment....
'You're never free,' Dara said, realizing it as she said it.
-When something goes wrong in a family, it takes generations to wipe it out.- Those words came to Dara, something from a history book, a book about kings and queens she once found in the den long ago.
Marie, Charlie, they thought they could escape it, through leaving, or trying to. Through other people, lovers. But they both ended right back where they started. In their mother's house, her third-floor hideaway.
'I guess you're right,' the woman said. 'You blame everything on that one person.You think if that one person is gone, everything will be perfect and good.' She slid her sunglasses back on. 'But in the end, that person is you.”




“It is the brave individual who will refuse to elevate themselves at the expense of others.”

“Usually the secrets we keep deep down, ain't meant to hurt other people [...]. Not saying they won't, but not through intentions. Those deep secrets, we hide away because we're afraid what other people might think. How they might judge us, if they knew. And nobody's judgment we scared of more than the one we give out hearts to.”



“A relationship is like a bottle of old wine. Once a broken bottle it's a broken bottle. Unless you can work on a relationship with the same care, love, and joy as it was it's the first day. Which no one can.”

“you prefer,
you refer,
and then you confer
only to deter.”

“And when you lose the best woman you ever knew because you failed to do anything but make her feel like shit...know that it was your own god damn fault because when you had her all she wanted was to love you and you did everything to show you didn't care. You did everything to kill that love until it finally disappeared. And the thing is, you'll be the one who despairs when you see another man cherishing the woman you refused to treasure despite her obvious wretched devotion.”

“His time to speak had run out. Staring at her picture on his screen, he touched her face. She smiled back at him. The call disconnected. He wondered how they had done so too.”



“The chill in her heart seemed to mock her as it echoed “critters,” “debris,” and “tempestuous.” The iciness inside of her only hardened as she contemplated how she had so callously left her husband behind at the gas station. Surely no woman in her right mind would do what she had done.
As she examined these thoughts, she tried to make order of them and what caused the break--for something had definitely been broken. Cracked. Fractured. And now those frozen fractals were piercing her heart and mind. She would add “soul” but at this point, she wondered what had become of hers.”



“It was when I said,
“There is no such thing as the truth,”
That the grapes seemed fatter.
The fox ran out of his hole.
You . . . You said
“There are many truths,
But they are not parts of a truth.”
Then the tree, at night, began to change,
Smoking through green and smoking blue.
We were two figures in a wood.
We said we stood alone.
It was when I said,
“Words are not forms of a single word.
In the sum of the parts, there are only the parts.
The world must be measured by eye”;
It was when you said,
“The idols have seen lots of poverty,
Snakes and gold and lice,
But not the truth”;
It was at that time, that the silence was largest
And longest, the night was roundest,
The fragrance of the autumn warmest,
Closest and strongest.”



“A conversation that doesn’t affect the soul is an unfinished journey!”

“right now, i feel i am someone who is cold, insecure, nervous, idle. i am not the person i dream of being. i want to be warm and joyful, like i used to be before i decided i was too fucked up. i crave harmony in my relationships—i want to be better at considering others’ pain, and understanding their points of view without making snap judgments. i want to be patient. i want to be the free spirit i know that i am, not limited by my anxiety or depression.”



“I always wanted to be defined by love - while never knowing that these hearts suffer the most.”

“Workers are begging us to lighten their load, to remove the burdens, the hassles, and the irritants that come with video meetings.”



“If you say, I know just how you feel, you show the other person you’re thinking about how you feel, and you’re assuming your experience is the same as theirs.”



“The first part of empathy, the first requirement for action on their behalf, is to understand how they feel.”



“Self-other awareness enables you to show respect for their feelings instead of being overwhelmed by their feelings, your pity, or your intolerance.”



“Savvy leaders use empathy to relieve that emotional strain. They use it so that video meetings are beneficial for everyone.”



“Empathy greases the wheels of productivity.”



“In an ever-changing, hyper-competitive workplace and marketplace, for you to truly be of worth as a leader, you therefore know: you must develop your capacity for empathy.”



“When what they feel evokes something familiar in you, you’re likely to mimic their emotions unconsciously.”



“I wanted to tell her they’d all have new names soon, new lives. That it didn’t matter. But that wasn’t true. It mattered who you were and where you were from. The baby had once had parents, and those parents had given their daughter a name.”



“Perhaps the greatest benefit of being Thoughtfully Fit is that it allows you to save your energy for the things that matter most to you. Rather than using up your energy stomping around, being angry, harboring resentment, trying to change people, or cleaning up the messes you made from acting thoughtlessly, you can use these practices to help build strong, honest relationships and get back to working on what you do best.”



“I'll be taking you out for coffee later this week, and you can give me all the details. In the meantime, I'll commence hating him just a
little
, in case I need material to seed hating him a lot.”



“It might not be the right way to end our journey, but it's the best way possible”



“It takes a while to believe that someone who promised to be with you forever has left you forever.”

“Isn’t that what loving someone is? Taking a chance every single day that they’ll stick around? That the rug won’t get pulled out from under you?”



“We all have stories like that, stories we rely on to establish our charm in the beginning of relationships.”



“The things that help you sleep all the way through it. Back-breaking labor might do it; or liquor. Surely a body--friendly if not familiar--lying next to you. Someone whose touch is a reassurance, not an affront or a nuisance. Whose heavy breathing neither enrages not disgusts, but amuses you like that of a cherished pet. And rituals help too: door locking, tidying up, cleaning teeth, arranging hair, but they are preliminaries to the truly necessary things. Most people want to crash into sleep.”



“Hemingway writes of people becoming stronger in the broken places, which is a heartening thought, and sometimes true. All too often, though, it belongs in the file that Jim Webb labeled typical Hemingway bullshit.”



“Ultimately, the people we spend the most time with will greatly influence the person we become, the leader we become.”



“What we witness playing out in the relationships of our public figures we risk finding acceptable in our private lives. Feminists have connected women’s sexual subordination to their unequal status in society, and have strived to transform women’s expectations in their private lives. Private dignity at home equates to dignity in the workplace and the public sphere.”




“It wasn’t always that way for the wives of powerful men. Prior to the 1960s, the press generally kept mum about the sex lives of politicians. When Eleanor Roosevelt discovered her husband’s affair by reading a love letter, she kept it to herself — and used it to gain the upper hand in her marriage, which had the additional benefit of setting her free to pursue writing and social activism.”



“Patriarchy’s influence often lives in the minds of women who were raised in a certain way and who aspire to a certain type of greatness — as one half of a powerful, leading couple. They act from behind the scenes, from behind a husband, because their goals and dreams, their stature in the world, is achieved most effectively through the influence of men — or so they believe. Without their husbands, they seem to doubt that they can fully express themselves. The motives of women in power political couples may be foreign to women in private life, but we should consider that the women who hold or aspire to great power have unique pressures and uncompromising standards. Does that compromise make sense when the couple can do so much good in the world, accomplish their political and policy goals, and build a platform and legacy for their children and grandchildren? Political women struggle with these questions.”



“To leave the marriage behind is to step out of the spotlight. It means fading into normalcy, returning to ordinary life, perhaps an impossible admission for women who have built their egos on being one member of a powerful team. To divorce might be to admit defeat for women who have come to see themselves as extraordinary and who circulate with other famous and history-making figures.”



“For each of these women, the fear of the unknown — of leaving a marriage and casting off alone — may have bound them to a marriage where there is insensitivity, neglect, or even outright abuse. People learn intimacy at home, and when those early standards are set too low, a wife may second-guess her judgment about when and whether she should leave.”



“According to polygamy, men are royals and women so loyal.”

“Sure, love happens," he said finally. "But it's better to be realistic so shit is not constantly blowing up in your face. And love is way more likely to blow up in your face than to bring eternal happiness. And if it doesn't hurt you, then you're the one hurting someone else.
"Entering a relationship is borderline sadomasochistic. Especially when you can get everything you would from a romantic relationship from a friendship, without destroying anyone's life when it inevitably ends.”



“I can tell you that occasionally you have to directly ask them why they're doing what they do. You might be surprised by the answer. No one tells you that this is a big part of relationships. Sometimes it's not all about big misunderstandings. Sometimes it's about learning how to talk to each other. We all have insecurities, and we have to help each other navigate around them.”



“Love will take you to the strangest land.”

“Love is full of peace and rage. It's another synonym of freedom - sacrifice is necessary.”

“You're not a slut. You're an extremely generous person with perilously low standards.”



“In an interview I can’t seem to find, they asked Diddy, “when did you know you were successful?” He responded, “the first time I flew without luggage.”
I always believed this would be incredible if we did this in our -ships (friendships, partnerships, intimate relationships, etc.). Imagine showing up with none of that STUFF weighing us down. We’d be free to move about the land and discover things new that’d cover us.”

“Your soul mate should be your sole mate.”



“Maybe things can always get better between people who want to do a good job loving each other. Maybe that's all it takes.”



“The moment I began to question if romantic relationships were my anchor in the storm or bricks sinking me to the bottom of the ocean; was the very moment I chose to focus on myself.”

“You're a mystery. Different people bring to light different sides of you.”

“Some things and people may be giving you pain. But you can't let go of them because the void that will be left behind is even more painful.”

“Love is not a reaction, but a carefully nurtured creation.”



“The more I was afraid of getting hurt, the more cautious I was, and this impacted my ability to deepen my relationships with others.”



“تذكر ألا تقترب كثيرًا للورود؛ هي لن تعطيك حبًا طاهرًا مثل حبي أبدًا
بل هي مخادعة تآثرك بجمالها ورائحتها وما إن تقترب حتى تجرحك بـ أشواكها
أما أنا فـ برغم كوني كالصبار أخترت أن تنبت أشواكي بداخلي منذ أن أحببتك حتى لا تمسَّك في يومٍ ما
ولكنك بكل أسفٍ فضلت أن تنخدع بـ المظاهرِ على المجازفةِ
ولذلك صدقني لن تجد أحد يحبك بكل صدق رغم سوداويته كما فعلت أنا.”

“في عالم آخر
بلا عوائق
بلا قيود
بلا نصيب
بلا ظروف
عانقني بقوة رغمًا عن كل عُقدي النفسية
وأخبرني إن كل شيء سـ يكون على ما يرام
في عالم آخر”

“كيف لي أن أنظر لـ عينيك الآن تلك التي نُهِمَ بها قلبي وأنا أرى بها بريق لـ أخرى بينما كانت نظرتك لي دائمًا "عادية”

“لا أريد حبًا ورديًا بل أحتاج حبًا رماديًا.. يشاركني عتمة ليلي قبل ضي صباحي
أحتاج لـ مَن أتناقش معه حول معتقداتي الغريبة دون أن يُسيء فهمي،
لـ مَن أحكي له عن محاولات أنتحاري المتكررة دون خجل،
لـ مَن يتفهم اكتئابي، ويتحمل حزني وعصبيتي غير المُبررين
لـ مَن يحتضني في نوبات بكائي المفاجأة، ويشعرني بالأمان في ليالي خوفي،
و لـ مَن يُطمئن عقلي حتى يتوقف عن قلقه الدائم
أحتاج لـ مَن يتقبل سوداويتي ويحبني كما وددتُ أن أحب نفسي..”

“ربما تعثر عليّ وأنت تحلق من سحابةٍ إلى أخرى، و تنتشلني من الغيوم إلى صفائك لـ تُضمد جناحي الجريح.. وحينها سـ أصنع لنا كوبان من الشوكلاتة الساخنة مع قطع من السحاب تطوف أعلاها أما عن السكر فلا حاجة له في وجودك.”

“Someday you will meet her. She will make you feel serene and calm. She will understand you. You won't have to explain her things about you and your life.”

“Working to be physically fit takes time and effort. In the same way, being Thoughtfully Fit—responding thoughtfully in every situation—also takes time and effort. When you’re physically fit, every movement feels easier. When you’re Thoughtfully Fit, you have greater stability in your thoughts and emotions, and your life and relationships feel easier.”



“His laughter sounds almost surprised, and I wonder if having fun during sex is unusual for him. Rolling around in the sheets and laughing together had always been one of my favourite things back in the days when I'd tried relationships.”



“Those who love so much should focus their thoughts on beauty, and then learn to close the other eye when seeing the ugliness of the subject presented.”

“This world is too crowded; People are violating each other's physical and mental space. In times such as this, just not poking into anyone's life is a great deed of charity.”

“It is mortifying to refuse a man and then discover that his main feeling is bewilderment”



“being together was as easy and natural as being alone, without any of the loneliness”




“We choose people based on their looks and completely fail to understand their heart. We sleep under the same blanket struggling with our empty hearts; you love his strong jawline but, fail to know his weaknesses, his hands stays on your waist all through the night but, he fails to understand the emptiness within you.
From (The Awakening)”

“Newcomers to success always seek attention and be seen in the newspapers; while the truly rich people hide behind closed doors.”

“I thought I was in love a couple of times, but I rather think it was only infatuation. It bothered me briefly, but I always got over it. I mean, for a while I'd think, after some perfectly pointless involvement that was far more trouble than it was worth- I'd think, 'Oh God, I hope I don't get infatuated with anybody every again.' And it's been sixteen, seventeen years, so I think I'm safe. I realized I was accident-prone in that direction anyway, so the hell with it. Cats have the same sort of nuisance value, so to speak. They occupy me.”



“It is not how much you are loving someone but how long you stay the course of loving someone that is the true measure of love.”

“There are those who give a penny and demand a bill; and walk with you an inch but claim a mile from you.”

“Love stays only between those two people who are truly and fully committed to each other. Love is for people who treat each other with respect, for those who always have a feeling of deep admiration for their partner for their abilities, qualities and achievements.
- From (The Awakening)”

“When love stays, your partner helps you to grow. They will not make you ‘feel less’ on a purpose. They don’t end up abusing you with their words or actions.

From (The Awakening)”

“Seeing your relationship as a journey together towards self-fulfillment will be the first step to keep the love growing.
From (The Awakening)”

“It’s all about how you stay madly in love with your partner through thick and thin, through ups and downs of life.
From (The Awakening)”

“To start living a joyful life after the breakup, you need to allow yourself to grieve, try not to fight your feelings, choose to talk about your feelings, no matter how difficult you feel - constantly remind yourself that moving on from that person is your end goal. It’s important to remind yourself you still have a beautiful future without anyone by your side.
From (The Awakening)”

“You behave like the perfect person with others. But you unload all your mental crap on those who are close to you. Is it fair?”

“Not knowing someone fully, getting into the relationship without clarity makes it all complicated and the story ends almost in the blinking of an eye.
From (The Awakening)”

“No matter what, you should not forget that you both are individuals with different opinions, views and preferences. Expecting your partner to read your mind every time is not right!
From (The Awakening)”

“Haiku:
When we are rooted
In love nothing can uproot
Us from the other.”

“Those who seek happiness in marriage always come back with disappointments.”

“Marriage is a daring game. Staying single is missing out on all the pleasures of life. It's like trying to invent a one-sided coin.”

“Two horses stand before you. One is domesticated, meek, and loyal. The other is wild, bold and fickle. You feel attracted towards the wild one. And then you complain why it is not loyal!”

“Together we glow
Brighter than the sun and moon
Combined, we are love.”

“Your pain won’t impress anyone. The people your pain does impress aren’t worth impressing.”




“When you're glued to someone with a strong adhesive, you can't just let go of them. You have to let go of your skin, your flesh, a part of your heart and soul. It's extremely painful but equally sacred because spiritual journey is all about letting go of yourself piece by piece, layer by layer.”

“When you wrongly blame a person for your misery, you create a fictitious entity that has no connection with that real person, you create a ghost that will possess you and eat you piece by piece.”

“Prostitution is the relationship or marriage without the romance, commitment, promises, lies, etc.… and the mattering of the man’s sexual performance.”

“Two free souls walking together is called love; It's an energizing experience. Two people (one insecure and other reckless) tied to each other with a rope is called attachment; It's a draining experience.”

“I fucked them because I liked predictable men, the guarded and repressed. Sensitive men wouldn’t be trusted; they assumed their sensitivity made them special, deserving of praise. Most sensitive men were, at their cores, narcissists who constructed elaborate expectations for how relationships were meant to evolve. When those expectations weren’t met, the facade of sensitivity deteriorated into a petulant rage.”



“Love is only insured in Grace the Heartbeat of God's mercy. Love isn't what we say it is; Love is God's language of unselfishness dished on a plate of Sacrifice and Grace.”

“When your Spouse or Partner invests their time informing very 'dick and harry' about your marital or relationship issues, tarnishing your name and destroying your marriage or relationship in the process, find your exit because YOU and that Marriage or Relationship were never of VALUE to them.”

“Spend time building your marriage, pray, and speak life into each other's destiny for the success of your marriage is dependent on what you declare on each other.”

“A mind without Christ is a reservoir filled with Crisis”

“Worship is God's melodious delicacy encased in Obedience”

“It is important to remember kindness to the people around you and to

“New friendship memo: For us there would be no arbitrary rules, obligations, or expectations. We would not owe each other anything other than admiration, respect, love.”



“A woman like that...she doesn't come around all the time, but when she leaves; you never forget her. I'm telling you, brother...that one isn't like the rest. You better dust off and give her your best - or you'll never get another shot and wonder what happened with the best you ever got.”

“We fall in mad love and mad hatred with our fantasies, not with real people. No real person deserves mad love and mad hatred.”

“عانقني بــ قوة..
دَعني أتسلل داخل ضلوعك..
وإصنع لي بيتًا على ذلك الجبل الذي يُسمى قلبك..
بيتًا أختبئ فيه من كل مخاوفي؛
من البشر،
من عقلي،
من اكتئابي وكل أمراضي النفسيه،
وحتى خوفي من حُبك..
وعِدني أن لا تهجرني في هذا البيت،
أن تمر عليّ بين الحين والأخر
فإني أخاف الوحده،
وأخاف هجرك.”

“ولكن قبل أن تذهب.. أخبرني ماذا أقول للنجوم حينما تسألني عنك ؟
أخبرني كيف لي أن أقول لـ جسدي المُنهك إن حضنك لم يَعد ملجأه ؟
كيف لي أن أقول لـ قلبي المَنْهُوم أن يتوقف عن النبض لـِ أجلك ؟
كيف لي أن أقول لـ عقلي المُتمرد أن يتوقف عن التفكير بـ تفاصيلك ؟
كيف لي أن أقول لـ روحي البائسه أن تتوقف عن التعلق بالحياة لـِ أجلك ؟”

“أعترف إن عقلي لا يكُف عن مقرانتي بها
أتعلم..؟ هو أيضًا وبكل قسوة يراها مثالية غير مُبالٍ بـ قلبي الكَليم
أعترف أنها تشبه أول شعاع لـِ الشمس وقت الشروق، بينما أنا حالكة كـ منتصف ليلة يجتاحها الآرق.. وأنت تخاف الظلام
أعترف أنها تشبه وردة في الربيع، بينما أنا كـ ورقة شجر تائهة في رياح الخريف.. وأنت تمقُت الخريف
أعترف أنها تشبه نيسان في دفئها، بينما أنا قارصة البرد كـ أول تشرين.. وأنت تحتاج دفئها
أعترف إنها كـ نسمة هواء في الصيف، بينما أنا عاصفة شتوية.. وأنت تُفضل الصيف
أعترف أنها تفوقني في كل شيء ولكن.. عدا حُبك
فأنا بكل سوداويتي تلك صدقني أحببتك كما لم أحب نفسي.”

“If you just need something to talk, let's talk in baby language. ba-ba la-la da-da ha-ha. I don't want you to ride the vehicle of words. I want you to stay with me fully in the present moment.”

“Cheating fuels some people’s never-ending endeavours to maintain the false impression that their relationships or marriages are not dead.”

“The story of one life cannot be told separately from the story of other lives. Who are we? The question is not simple. What we call the self is part of a larger matrix of relationship and society. Had we been born to a different family, in a different time, to a different world, we would not be the same. All the lives that surround us are in us.”



“If you feel an emptiness inside you, it's good. Your desperation to fill it is not good. In desperation you will fill it with junk. Become available to it. It will attract what it needs. And it will make you do what needs to be done.”

“It is not easy to say "I love you". It is a great responsibility that we both will take. If you don't have the same feeling I have towards you, I will wish you all the best in your life and never obsess or even annoy you. But if not, you will be my whole world and I will be loyal to your love for the end of my life.”

“Pity, I would have called it, but it wasn’t pity. It was something far scarier and more destabilizing, something I would never let myself name so long as I needed to feel superior to their pain.”



“We are faithful as long as we love, but you demand faithfulness of a woman without love, and the giving of herself without enjoyment. Who is cruel there--woman or man? You of the North in general take love too soberly and seriously. You talk of duties where there should be only a question of pleasure.”



“We shouldn't try holding to those who simply dont wish to be held.”

“I guess the reason relationships don't work is not because of the way people were raised, but because of what they have done to themselves as adults.”

“A man needs to be extremely ugly, to become famous or rich, and still be regarded as ugly by most women.”

“The price of a successful relationship is devotion. Devotion is, essentially, commitment to something we value. What are we devoted to? Surely not what another person wants. I think most people would agree that being devoted to that would be problematic even with the best of people. So, what exactly are we devoted to? We are devoted to the well-being of another person. And we are devoted to the wellbeing of the relationship. We honour the value of the other person and we honour the worth of the relationship.”



“Grow with or grow out. Don't remain stuck.”

“When someone suffocates you with what they believe is love, even as you feel your air supply being cut off, you at least feel embraced.”




“The marriage certificate proves that you are the only person your husband or wife is married to. Not that you are the only person he or she is getting sexual pleasure from.”

“His widow Anna dedicated most of her energy in her later years to shaping Dostoyevsky’s legacy and presenting it to the world.”



“The last words you should say to anyone at night—whether it’s your spouse, your children, your dog, your cat or yourself—are “I love you.”



“When you expect reward and don't get it, it feels like punishment. When you expect love and don't get it, it feels like hate. With expectations we create opposite of what we expect.”

“Do you have kids?" strangers asked almost every day.
"No," I said, not wanting to explain, because, really, it's an unimaginative question, full of their beliefs about what family means, about who counts as kin, and it's a hard question for anyone with a complicated relationship to family making, for those of us who've experience miscarriage or failed adoptions or the death of a child, for those of us estranged or embattled or in grief. It's a question I now refuse to ask. "Tell me about your family," I say instead, because I know belonging comes in all shapes and sizes, visible and invisible, hidden and made and chosen and found.”



“Though my mother had three boys and a girl, that Queen raised only sons...... interpret that whichever way you decide to hon'.”

“At the core, everything begins with the relationship we have within ourselves. When this relationship doesn’t exist (either it is ignored or abandoned) or is not healthy, that is when we start experiencing pain, anxiety, and disease.”

“We eat in silence. Caramel lies at my feet meowing, content she has a full belly. I like the weight of her on me; she feels real, solid. I like being wanted. I want to feel wanted.”



“I still fantasize about some people… thinking of how blissful it would have been if we would have just remained strangers.”

“Maintaining the sense of dignity while dealing with complexity of relations is the toughest challenge in almost everyone lives.”

“Please stop dating and marrying people who are your parents' types. The attraction will not last and you're doing it to fill an unmet need for approval that you never received from your family in childhood. Your romantic partner is not supposed to be a peace offering or any other kind of goodwill offering.”

“People should never start relationships based on how they feel (connect), but on how compatible they are because compatibility is what connects them and not their emotions.”

“When we look at love relationships in more detail, it is clear that the simple
word love cannot adequately describe the wide variety of feelings two individuals
can have for each other. In the first two stages of a love relationship, romantic love
and the power struggle, love is reactive; it is an unconscious response to the
expectation of need fulfillment. Love is best described as eros, life energy seeking
union with a gratifying object. When both partners in an intimate relationship make
a decision to create a more satisfying relationship, they enter a stage of transfor-
mation, and love becomes infused with consciousness and will; love is best de-
fined as agape, the life energy directed toward the partner in an intentional act of
healing. Now, in the final stage of a conscious partnership, reality love, love takes
on the quality of spontaneous oscillation, words that come from quantum physics
and describe the way energy moves back and forth between particles. When part-
ners learn to see each other without distortion, to value each other as highly as
they value themselves, to give without expecting anything in return, to commit
themselves fully to each other’s welfare, love moves freely between them without
apparent effort. The word that best describes this mature kind of love is not eros,
not agape, but yet another Greek word, philia,² which means “love between
friends.” The partner is no longer perceived as a surrogate parent or as an enemy
but as a passionate friend. It is where we experience the original connecting, when
the initial rupture is repaired, and we feel fully safe, relaxed, loved, joyful, and pro-
foundly connected.
When couples are able to love in this selfless manner, they experience a release
of energy. They cease to be consumed by the details of their relationship or to need
to operate within the artificial structure of exercises; they spontaneously treat each
other with love and respect. What feels unnatural to them is not their new way of
relating but the self-centered, wounding interactions of the past. Love becomes
automatic, much as it was in the earliest stage of the relationship, but now it is
based on the truth of the partner, not on illusion.
One characteristic of couples who have reached this advanced stage of con-
sciousness is that they begin to turn their energy away from each other toward the
woundedness of the world. They develop a greater concern for the environment,
for people in need, for important causes. The capacity to love and heal that they
have created within the relationship is now available for others.”

“Some people want or wanted to be married as soon as possible, so they can or could finally stop pretending to be worth marrying.”

“A woman only wants to be conquered after she's done the conquering. Rescued after she's done the rescuing. Then it's a choice she's actively made rather than a debt she needs to repay. I think the grand gesture you need to make is asking her for help.”



“Love can be defined in one word. "You".”

“Assume that people know only what you tell them, honor only what you request, and can't read your mind.”



“Thinking about the suffering of those you hold dear can reduce you to tears.”



“Relationships are not difficult, people are.”

“Everyone is bad in this world but you are good." If somebody says this to you, don't be so happy. You're soon going to enter in their list of bad people.”

“Crystal needed a plan; a procedure for dealing with her feelings… That was the problem with relationships. They defied logic.”



“There is nothing more important than the relationships we have, which is why we have to be conscious about the people we choose to have in our lives.”



“​Gaby: Calm down! I don’t believe in monogamy, okay? I don’t understand how you can be with one partner all your life. Love just the same person for the rest of your life, be committed to one person. ​Nathaniel: I can’t believe… This can’t be true. ​Gaby: Let me explain it in your language. It's like listening to the same song throughout your life. The same song every freaking day. Sooner or later you’ll get tired of it. Then those notes, that melody, those words will get on your nerves, and, in the end, one day, you will be done. That’s why there are people like me. We listen to everything, rap, pop, rock, country, even classical music. You must understand, you can’t get everything from one partner. I came back because I knew that no matter what, you will always be there waiting for me. You are giving me things others can’t give and vice versa. It’s easy.”



“When the time comes, if it comes, you have got to be ready to leave a relationship or a marriage, not necessarily because you stopped loving the other person, but because you realise that with them, you cannot be, or become, the person that you know you want or need to be.”

“Sometimes the love that it takes to look at your partner and realise that they should remain the way that they are, and not evolve alongside you, because they're happier as who they are just like that; whilst knowing that you must evolve, you must go on without them, because you have this one life and you know there's so much more on your path for you; is a far greater love than staying. Sometimes, leaving someone takes more courage and more love than wanting a life for them beside you, one that they aren't supposed to live.”

“The beginning of the end of any relationship is when one individual begins to ignore the other person.”

“Don’t try to change me.
Love, Embrace all sides of my imperfection, and Inspire me to become the greatest version of myself.
I’ll do the same for you.
-Iryna Dalton”

“Anything that occupies your mind is your occupation. For some people quarreling is an occupation. They fear losing it more than a job-goer fears losing job. Because emptiness of mind is scarier than emptiness of stomach.”

“It is ironic that the very ties that bind a husband and wife in theory- home and family- often serve to separate them in fact.”



“Everyone can love you when you have everything, but one who loves you when you have nothing, that’s the person who truly cares for you.”




“.“We need to listen to each other deeply and patiently so that we can hear the silence behind our words.”



“It's when relationship turn to bindings, lesser of morals quit.”

“Every time you try to change someone, you are trying to change someone that doesn’t exist. They only exist in your head. People are who you believe them to be.”

“Some women wish the pregnancy tests also told them who the fathers are.”



“Jealous men forgive sooner than anyone else, and all women know it. The jealous man (having first made a terrible scene, of course) can and will very promptly forgive, for example, a nearly proven betrayal, the embraces and kisses he has seen himself, if, for example, at the same time he can somehow be convinced that this was 'the last time' and that his rival will disappear from that moment on . . . Of course the reconciliation will only last an hour, because even if the rival has indeed disappeared, tomorrow he will invent another, a new one, and become jealous of this new one. And one may ask what is the good of a love that must constantly be spied on, and what is the worth of a love that needs to be guarded so intensely? But that is something the truly jealous will never understand . . . It is also remarkable that these same lofty-hearted men, while standing in some sort of closet, eavesdropping and spying, though they understand clearly . . . all the shame they have gotten into of their own will, nevertheless . . . while standing in that closet, will not feel any pangs of remorse.”



“She was still in love with her husband but she was not ready to live with him.”



“Relationships are not any kind of agreements. We cannot treat them as Contract and we cannot apply the rule of contracts to break the relationships.”



“His headlights were intercepted with great purpose, said the deer.”

“Her headlights were intercepted with great purpose, said the deer.”

“Those headlights were intercepted with great purpose, said the deer.”

“وهروبي منك
ليس لأنني لا أحبك
بل لأنني لا أحب ذاتي،
لأنني أدرك تمامًا أنني لا أصلح للحب،
إنني فتاة لا تُحب،
ولا تقوى على الحب..
أهرب لأنني ما عُدت أقوى على خذلان اخر.”

“لاحظت عائلتي عدم تركيزي الدائم
ولاحظت صديقتي المقربة كثرة تحدثي عنك
ولاحظت النجوم ان هناك من أصبح يشاركها نظرة الأهتمام والحب
وقهوتي أيضًا لاحظت عدم أهتمامي بها مؤخرًا
وجميعهم غاروا منك؛ فـ وبختني عائلتي، وسخرت مني صديقتي، وتذمرت النجوم فما عادت تظهر لي، وكادت قهوتي أن تفور
وأنت.. أنت مازالت حتى الان لم تنتبه إن نظرتي لك ليست ب "عادية"!”

“وتشابهت أنت وقهوتي في الإدمان والأمان
كلاكما دائي ودوائي أيضًا؛ قربكما مؤذي ومع ذلك لا أقوى على البعد
كلاكما تتيحان الفرصه لعقلي أن لا يتوقف عن التفكير تاركًا روحي للنوم ومع ذلك لا أحد غيركم يُعالج ألالامي
وكلاكما تُتعبان قلبي ومع ذلك لا يعشق غيركما..”

“Communication: It Matters
Improper Communication will serve a relationship.”

“Näin jälkikäteen asiaa katsoessani olen tajunnut, että rakkauselokuvat ja Disney-sadut ovat paljon vaarallisempia kuin sotapelit. Nuoret tytöt haaveilevat koko elämänsä satumaisesta prinssistä ja elämästä, jollaista ei ole muualla kuin kirjan kansien välissä. Sellaista satuprinssin paikkaa ei voi kukaan oikea ihminen täyttää.”



“But that is how men are! Ungrateful and never satisfied. When you don’t have them they hate you because you won’t; and when you do have them they hate you again, for some other reason.”



“Choose their absence over disrespect”

“If I cheated on my spouse or partner, and they made the choice to stay with me regardless, I would leave that person. I will never be perceived as someone who needs a nice warm bath to come home to after rolling around outside in the grass; a coddled person, an infantile person, a person who's choices are perceived as the mistakes of a toddler, only needing to be slapped on the hand and then coddled. That would kill the relationship for me, that would kill everything.
I'm not an inconsequential flower, I'm not a purified version washed down to be palatable; I am an equal. My mistakes should be treated as mistakes. I don't need forgiveness for anything that I do.”

“One of the biggest problems that most men have with life is that the vagina comes with the woman.”



“Men pay for sex. Women pay with sex.”



“The question is not whether or not someone in your life is using you, but how are they using you.”



“He stared into Bubbe's kind dark eyes. "They say you can't go home again."
"You can't, no, never." She hugged him. "But if you keep your mind open, you can always find a new home inside the old one.”



“Many of us want to have relationships because we want a nest, a cozy place of acceptance; that unconditional circumstance. Relationships have become the using of another person as soft stuff to build nests with. Many can do this without even liking the other person, or feeling connected to them, or even wanting to actually be near them. I think the animals are better; an animal would never live with someone they don't like, because they don't have to. They have no religion, no laws, no society. And yet, we see swans and wolves and others: mating for life! For no other reason than that they've found their one-and-only.”

“Love is not gentle,
like the dust of a room;
love is a thing that happens
in a room, and becomes dust.”

“Some of those who think that men are dogs are men, thanks to things such as pseudo-feminism and homosexuality.”

“Men are born with nothing with which to buy. Women are born with something to sell.”



“Her love was not weak or inadequate. It just presented her with impossible choices.”



“Your desperation to stop someone from going away from you actually drives them away faster.”

“Alguns casamentos não são lá grandes maravilhas. Alguns amores têm limitações bem claras. Às vezes as separações acontecem porque as pessoas não combinavam, para começo de conversa.
Às vezes o divórcio não é um abalo sísmico. Às vezes são só duas pessoas saindo de uma situação nebulosa”



“As far as monks are concerned, I believe that they are bad experiencers. They know nothing about the struggles of a normal human being. The struggle to stay alive. The struggle to survive in this capitalist world. The trauma of being in a bad relationship. Juggling between the myriads of emotions and sentiments. These monks are oblivious to such battles which a normal human being fights every day.”




“George says that if you look at the person someone chooses to have "a relationship" with, you'll see what they think of themselves. So Harrison is what I think of myself. It's hardly a relationship, but nevertheless he is a choice. I examined all the options and chose the most likely to leave. No emotional investments. Never love for me—only obsession. Someone has to stand still for you to love them—my choices are always on the run.”



“Negativity is any thought, word, or deed that tells your partner, “You’re not OK when you think what you think or act the way that you act.” In essence, you are rejecting your partner’s “otherness.” We sometimes feel the need to negate our partners when they do or say something that makes us uncomfortable. Usually, they are just being themselves. But from our point of view, they are threatening an image that we have of them, or they are failing to meet an unspoken need of our own.”



“Sometimes the best way to fight for your relationships is by refusing to fight with your loved ones.”

“I think it's usually better to face the world as it is. The more we try to hide from something, the more power we give it.”



“If you had to think so hard about whether or not you want to be with someone, what was the point?”



“The divorced use the large number of failed marriages as a reason why we should not get married. The married use it as a reason why we should get ourselves a good husband or wife.”

“لا تقترب ف أنا لست ذلك البريق الذي تبحث عنه
أنا مخادعه كالقمر يا عزيزي؛ أُبهر الناس بمظهري المضيء وأنا في الواقع معتمه
ما أنا إلا مجرد بقايا حطام كالسُدم.. رماد تأخده رياح اليأس أينما تشاء
فقد سقطت في فجوة زمنية ف أبتلعني الماضي، وأصبت بفوبيا الفراق
أنا لستُ نجمة كما تظن بل ثقبًا أسود يجذبك بغموضه ومن ثم تبتلعك سوداويته
لن تصل إلى في نهايه المطاف بل وستفقد روحك في دربي..”

“وإني كللت التقدم في طريقنا
الذي لا يقطع أحد به
الخطى سواي
تعب جسدي من التقدم
وهو يراك ثابت بعيد
كأنك صخرة جامدة
مّل قلبي وهو ينتظرك أن
تجازف بالأقتراب
أرهقت قدمي من السير
نحوك فكلما تقدمت خطوة
تبتعد أنت ألف هاربًا
فـ أدركت أن تقدمي بلا جدوى
لذلك لن أجازف أنا أيضًا بالتقرب مجددًا”

“Our relationships are what encourage the heart and nourish the soul.”

“We’ve been programmed by evolution to single out a few specific individuals in our lives and make them precious to us.”

“The many delights of solo living are seldom shown in the media, just as the pain, vulnerability, and often conflict of living alongside the same person for years and years are rarely depicted, unless a "break-up" is involved. What is the impact of seeing the repetition, over and over and over again, of the "happily-ever-after" of getting together with a partner as the ending of every story from fairy tale to action movie? How much do we internalize the notion that this is the goal we should be thriving for?”



“Perhaps an overarching binary when it comes to love and relationships is the one which privileges partners over friends. You can see this reflected in phrases like "just friends", "more than friends" and "friendzone", all of which suggest that being friends is inferior to - and less desirable than - being partners with someone.”



“The partner/friend binary places coupled, monogamous, romantic, sexual, partnered love right at the pinnacle of human experience. Like the sexual and gender binaries this is quite a new, Western dominant culture thing to do, and certainly not the way that relationships have been done globally, or across time.”



“I wonder if I'm a bigamist?" Clare is eating something pistachio- coloured that has several large shrimp poised over it as though they are nearsighted old men reading a newspaper.
"I think you're allowed to marry the same person as many times as you want," Charisse says.”



“You were a bare rock. Someone hammered and took a piece out of you. You can either cry about it or let me chisel some more pieces out of you and sculpt you into a divine form.”

“Don't leave the depths of your soul to be with someone. Let them leave their shallowness to be with you.”

“REAL FATHERS
Fathers who protect their children deserve appreciation.
These are gatherers of food who fend off starvation.
Fees are paid in full; there's never depreciation.
Daughters and toddlers are safe under their nation.
They prove that their children come first.
Payroll to payload, they're there to play their verse.
Main role, second role, they're there to nurse.
Male role, great role, they stop the abandonment curse.
Their kids' needs are satisfied, they're never hollow.
Their kids feel prioritised, the rest follow.  ”

“How can we be afraid of those we love? It was a question that puzzled me then, and puzzles me still.”



“She's tragically scarred with an avant-garde, spastic heart - yet radically guarded (anti-romantic garden) - tactless, though perhaps smarter; and so her soul carries an ego too heavy to be swept off her feet: Modernity's narcissist.”

“Those who love you will understand your feelings even if you didn't use the right words to express them. Those who don't love you will misunderstand you even if you used the right words.”

“Alexandra, you act like a relationship owes you something. Like it's supposed to make you whole or better or more fulfilled or excited without working on it. You want a perfect marriage to appear the way you can order delivery for dinner - like it's sitting there waiting for somebody to bring it to you in neat packaging. It's not a thing you can order, it's a fluid state. A process.”



“Years sneak by quickly, on tip-toe, scoffing and suddenly they give us a fright in the mirror or smack us on the back. Every minute is precious and we can't waste it on misunderstanding, impatience, jealousy, pettiness, or the other silly stuff that soils relationships. In truth this formula can be applied at any age because it's always the case that our days are limited.”



“Love unites. It speaks its own language and that language is always unifying.”



“She missed him, but some things are more important than missing. Like love. People have to come back if and when they are ready. Then they will come back with the right ideas or requests or, at very least, the right bargains. Every other arrangement can only be a dressed-up delusion.”



“He was a player. She didn’t play. And, if she did, it would have been for keeps.”



“How can I move on? With my thoughts and imaginations, I have turned you into a demigod. You're no longer a person; You're an idol in the temple of my heart. No, it can't be a move on. It has to be a sacrilege.”

“I don't deserve you; you deserve better " is a red flag. Men say this to create an empty challenge, an empty opportunity to change his mind. How often have you gone through hell for a guy who continues to say he doesn't deserve you but expects access to you both physically and emotionally. " I don't deserve you; you deserve better " is a warning. He's telling you that he doesn't intend to be what you need or to provide whatever is necessary for you to feel at peace with your decision to pursue him. The man who says this will break your heart every step of the way to test your tolerance and what he can get away with. The only way to hold him accountable is to walk away for good.”

“Those who are blessed with a soothing and healing aura attract badly broken people in their life. When their life looks like a junkyard, they are left to wonder, 'Am I blessed or cursed?”

“You see life; the best part of it is the one you spend with someone special. When you do, spend it with someone that is afraid of losing you in as much as you are afraid of losing them”

“Aren’t we all straving -
just for different hearts?”

“I write about you all the time, I said aloud. Every time I say "I", it refers to you.”




“Aren’t we all starving -
just for different hearts?”

“No matter what you do, some people will always wonder if you love them back. Emotional trauma can be like that.”

“Who would willingly walk the path of love without first being seduced by its promise?”



“Warmth is an emotional attitude towards chosen people. Love is inclusive of everyone and has no ulterior motive.”



“When we are a spiritual student, our gender identity is omni-gender and our relationship status is omni-relationship-status.”



“Single or partnered, on the spiritual path, everyone is both. And neither. We are omni-relationship-status.”



“Happiness is dependent on our circumstances; Joy is dependent on our relationship.”

“Relationships and friendships should be mutually beneficial; be it emotionally, mentally, physically or financially. When your relationship becomes one-sided, it becomes toxic. One party is constantly receiving, while the other is constantly giving.”



“A relationship in itself is a living being. A cat doesn't live as long as a tortoise. The utopian idea that all relationships should last a human lifetime has created so much mental pain and sickness in society.”

“If we demand, in any of our relationships, either perfection or nothing. we will get the nothing. Only when we have learned this will we be Bible-believing Christians, and only then will we understand something of life. Only then can we be more understanding toward men and show real compassion. Consequently, I would repeat, if in any of our relationships of life we demand perfection or nothing, we will have nothing.”



“I see how lost the elder son is. He has become a foreigner in his own house. I know the pain of this predicament. In it, everything loses its spontaneity. Everything becomes suspect, self-conscious, calculated, and full of second-guessing. There is no longer any trust. Each little move calls for a countermove; each little remark begs for analysis; the smallest gesture has to be evaluated. This is the pathology of the darkness. I cannot forgive myself. I cannot make myself feel loved. By myself I cannot leave the land of my anger. I cannot bring myself home.”



“I wish my friends would be a tad more selective before they jump in with both feet. Almost instantly… “they’re my world!!” Ummm, this is like your 8th world… You making a solar system?”

“A slightly more conscious awareness of writing as compensation may lend us energy to acknowledge our unrequited ache for more visceral forms of contact.”

“In life and especially marriage, many individuals come from homes that they are well versed and acquainted to be loved but know nothing about how to love others. We are loved by our parents, cousins, closer and distant relatives, friends, teachers, leaders and we get so entitled to be love and lose the art of loving others and pay the cost to maintain healthy and valuable relationships and connections. Learn to love!”

“In life and especially marriage, many individuals come from homes that they're well versed and know how to be loved, but unfortunately know nothing about how to love others. We continually receive love from our parents, siblings, cousins, grannies, closer and distant relatives, friends, teachers, leaders and everybody else that we get so entitled to be loved. It the process we lose the art and science of loving other people and we just expect only to receive from them. We lack the nerve to pay the cost to maintain healthy and valuable relationships or connections but easily let them fall apart. We need to learn how to love!”

“In life and especially marriage, many individuals come from homes that they're well versed and know how to be loved, but unfortunately know so little about how to love others. They continually receive love from our parents, siblings, cousins, grannies, closer and distant relatives, friends, teachers, leaders, spouses and everybody else around them that they get overly entitled to love. In the process they lose the art and science of loving other individuals around their life and only expect to receive affection but never reciprocate it. Simply said they have lost the nerve for the cost of healthy or valuable relationship but selfishly do let it crumble in their hands. They just need to learn how to love!”

“A girl or woman that drinks or smokes is very unlikely to still be a virgin.”



“We sometimes secretly wish we had the courage to just kiss someone who secretly wishes they had the courage to just undress us … and then make love to us.”

“It's much easier to break a thing that has already been broken once. Mending rarely makes it stronger.”



“Relationships can be like old shoes—we stay in them even when they are no longer functional because they are comfortable. But comfort is rarely an indication of a life well-lived.”

“If you’re not careful, you will empty yourself trying to be enough for someone else.”

“If you’re afraid to stand up to their toxicity because they focus on your reaction more than their own hurtful behavior, it’s time to leave. No more page turning… that’s what got you there in the first place… it’s time to close the book.”

“If a friend is telling you positive things about their job or relationships, it doesn't mean that they are happy in them. They may be just consoling themselves by counting the positives.”

“Great relationships are the key to personal and professional success.”



“I did my MA on Elizabethan women who demanded to choose their husbands. It really annoys me, that it's basically the same thing today. Who are we going to end up with?
[...]

It's a race,and everyone else is on the tracks and I'm at the wrong venue, with the wrong shoes on”



“We had loads in common but we just didn't see the world in the same way.”



“None of us has a right to dictate how another human being finds happiness. Our time on this planet is short and all types of commitment are valid when they're built on love.”



“Superficiality results in vacillating inconsistency, and emotions for the narcissistic person range from intense to detached on a regular basis. A healthy relationship should feel like a safe harbor in your life. Life throws us enough curve balls in the shape of money problems, work issues, medical issues, household issues, and even the weather. Sadly, a relationship with a narcissist can be one more source of chaos in your life, rather than a place of comfort and consistency.”




“Narcissists do not tolerate anything that feels like abandonment. The reaction to narcissistic injury is typically narcissistic rage and revenge. Many people who endure a narcissistic breakup will say that they had to start anew— and learned who their real friends were. Because they engage in projection (taking what they are feeling and projecting it onto someone else), and because they do not take responsibility for anything or anyone, they blame. Meet his behavior with dignified silence.”



“Sometimes true love needs a helping hand.”



“It’s satisfying to believe that our effort will translate into results, and in many areas of our lives it does. The one area it often does not is human relationships, and the one area it will never work is in a relationship. if you are expending so much effort and not achieving your goal (of pleasing your partner) then you must be doing something wrong or lacking something. Interestingly, most people don’t initially recognize that perhaps it is their partner who is unpleasable. Many people who have been through narcissistic relationships will say that they literally gave everything they had to the point they could not try anymore. This carries a tremendous toll for the giver, who will often give of themselves to the point of exhaustion, physical health problems, loss of friends and family, and even their own sense of self.”



“It's absolutely possible to experience bliss during breakups. Bliss that is different, but equal in value to, the euphoria experienced while sharing your life with someone. I am convinced that heartbreak is an unnaturally induced state which we were conditioned into believing is natural. It's a scam. I feel that the breaking of a relation can be equal in value to the making of it. And if we realize the joy that can be mined from the experience, we would eliminate this form of suffering, from our lives, altogether. You can feel catapulted into glistening self-love, enlightenment, growth and confidence, during emergence from the state of being in love with someone. It's a treasure trove of its own merit.”

“The darker dynamics of narcissism imply that one person in the relationship gives just about everything, and the other (the narcissist) just takes. If the relationship is reciprocal, compromise is effortless. The more challenging disappointments are the lack of empathy, the lack of connection, the lack of support.”



“In a healthy relationship, your partner is a great “dream-catcher.” However, when that unformed dream is laughed at, questioned, or belittled, it may not recover. Worse, you may scrap the whole idea. However, if there is one thing a narcissistic person cannot tolerate, it is being inconvenienced. Even just hearing about your bad day is an inconvenience. When you are in a relationship with a narcissist, it can slowly dawn on you that things work well as long as you are convenient.”



“Strong emotions make narcissists uncomfortable. In your darkest hours you may have to appease and soothe them. Ironically, if they are experiencing the loss, they will often stop the clocks and turn into their own self-focused, self-referenced mourning period, expecting all lives to halt for them. The lack of support in the face of a crisis represents one of the more devastating conditions. Illness in a partner can raise a wide array of reactions in the narcissist, ranging from anger and irritability that their narcissistic supply is otherwise preoccupied to resenting the attention your illness may bring to you to actually becoming anxious and in fact even helpful because they are concerned about losing your availability and presence.”



“Each time something more interesting than you turns up— at work, a person, an opportunity—he will ignore you again. The disappointment each time this takes place can be paralysing. I presented the idea of being “enough.” Always remember, you are more than enough, always have been, always will be. The narcissist also never feels like he is enough, so he is always seeking attention and affirmation from the outside. If he is never enough, then no one else is either, but he is not aware of this dynamic. It would be an entirely different experience if he sat with you and said, “I am very empty, and I will never feel like I am enough, so I know that I will always treat you like you are not enough, even though you are.” If your partner had that level of insight, then he would not be narcissistic.”



“Perhaps the hardest thing of all is to leave the illusion. A part of what you are leaving is an illusion, a mirage—something that actually is not there. And it is not real. And yet, it hurts. Ending a relationship is stressful, challenging, and psychologically difficult. Whether it has been going on for months or years, breaking up is hard to do. We consider issues, including what we are getting out of our relationship, whether there is someone else out there who might be better for us who is available and a good option, as well as what we might lose if we left. We do that algebra of the heart and if the numbers favor staying, we stay. If the numbers favor leaving, we leave.”



“Behaviors may shift temporarily, but the core issues will remain. The feelings will also shift and change every day. After your time served, and years spent trying to make it work, it can be quite galling to have your partner pick up and leave. Many times, the narcissist does decide to head out for greener pastures— typically a new partner—and even though getting rid of him is ultimately healthier and better for you, it still stings. The sting of being rejected. The sting of not feeling good enough. The sting that no matter how hard you tried, it was never enough. While that has nothing to do with you, it is a difficult pill to swallow when they decide to pack it in and leave.”



“That which holds us all together is very delicate.”



“Love dies hard, you know?”



“These e-mails from helplessness patients, I recognize that they are an emblem of their frustration and rarely achieve their goal. More often than not, the narcissistic partner will respond with only a short response of a few words, not respond at all, or respond to the most damning parts, and the thoughtful request or plea may simply turn into one more opportunity to experience their rage. There is no back door when someone does not or will not hear you—the e-mail may be cathartic for you, but expect no miracles. Your better bet is to write it and send it to a trusted friend. Or cast it off to sea, or burn it—just do not send it to your narcissistic partner.”



“While the feelings and symptoms of depression and anxiety experienced may be due to the helplessness engendered by the relationship, these feelings can also be generated by the ongoing lack of emotional reciprocity and mirroring in the relationship. Depression is a complex disorder, but the hallmark symptoms of depression—sad mood, lack of pleasure in activities that are typically pleasurable, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, social withdrawal, poor concentration, changes in sleep and appetite.”



“There is a difference between making excuses and “being understanding.” Your relationship is an investment—an investment of your time, your resources, and your emotions—and it may involve children, other family members, and finances. There is a lot to “protect,” so making excuses for your partner’s bad behavior becomes protective. Making excuses reflects a pattern over time, not just one bad day at the office. Making excuses involves taking similar facts and telling a story that denies your feelings while protecting your partner’s. And it is a pattern that happens repeatedly, to the point that you believe the excuses more than your own feelings. Understanding is a two-way street—a street made up of compromises shared and offered by both of you. Making excuses is a strategy for surviving a lack of empathy and a long drive down a one-way road.”



“Typical relationship books, they are about communicating more clearly, being more loving, and making time for your relationship. All of this is lovely advice, only if the other person is noticing or listening! Kierkegaard noted that “Love is the expression of the one who loves, not of the one who is loved.” The challenge is that when this expression is not met with any reciprocity, and in fact the opposite, it can be exhausting and demoralising. If you love more, then you will get more back. It’s not that linear, and while that may apply in a factory— work harder, make more widgets—it does not work in relationships, least of all with a narcissist. Personality patterns tend to be pretty entrenched—and the rules of rescue do not apply.”



“It’s painfully simple but also challenging to execute because it requires a rewrite, a re-rendering, a reboot, and a reframe. And the best part is that it requires nothing from your partner—this is entirely within your control. It is the most unromantic piece of advice you will ever receive: Manage your expectations. Let go of the rescue fantasy. If you don’t, and you decide to stay, it will only destroy you, bit by bit. So now that you know the beast is never going to turn into a prince.”



“When the world is supporting them, their needs are getting met, they do not think there is anything wrong anyhow, and they are unable to see, hear, or feel the needs of others, the likelihood of change is close to zero. The primitive and emotional nature of a close personal relationship means that the lack of empathy, the rage, the distance, the control, and the inconsistency have tremendous power in shaping the life and the inner world of a person in a narcissistic relationship. Close relationships can activate the best and the worst in us, but the deep emotional demands of an intimate relationship are out of reach for a person with narcissistic personality disorder.”



“Given that narcissists can often be quite vulnerable, again, because their self-esteem is so fragile and reliant on the judgments of other people, depression is not a surprising part of this picture. At times when they are depressed, especially for men, it is quite possible that their mood will be even more irritable than usual, or they will become more withdrawn, and seemingly more focused on themselves. The big-ticket symptoms we would like to see changed—the lack of empathy, the chronic entitlement, the grandiosity—tend to be most resistant to change, since they are linked so strongly to the core deficits of the disorder, such as an inability to regulate self-esteem.”



“How can love be such a wrecking ball?”



“The indifferent filler can keep the conversation moving, without giving the narcissist a hurtful target. He or she will likely find ways to insert some negativism here as well, perhaps mocking your opinion, calling you out for not being knowledgeable about a topic, or even labeling you as “dull.” Smile serenely and carry on. Your narcissist does not realize the triumph—you just dodged a bullet and did not play out the usual old patterns. He may even be frustrated, since he can’t get the same reactions out of you, and may have to find a new psychological punching bag.”



“His definition of “I love you” and your definition are likely completely different. It's an “I love you” crisis. The real challenge is not the words, or whether the other person means them, but rather being clear on your definition, your expectation, and ultimately how you want to be treated. Think about how you feel in this relationship, the quality of your communication and collaboration, and your partner’s behavior. Pay attention to the other person’s actions and regard. Saying “I love you” is easy; being present and engaged in a relationship is a different matter.”



“The belief that someday he will see how wonderful you are, and he will apologize and thank you for standing by his side. The hope of redemption. It is one of the primary messages of all world religions: Through love comes redemption. It is a dangerous sell, because it can be true and miraculous, but in the case of narcissism, redemption will almost never occur. By definition a personality disorder is almost impossible to change. Removing the hope will help you find your way to taking care of you.”



“It is appealing to think that once you survived it you will never repeat it. Be aware of your vulnerabilities and start looking for the qualities that make for a better long-term partner—compassion, kindness, respect, and empathy— rather than the flash in the pan qualities of charisma and ego. The risk of the narcissistic relationship is that it transforms you so profoundly and painfully that you feel that you are no longer you. Slowly over time you have cut off bits and pieces of yourself, so you feel as if you have lost your true self.”



“Avoid confusing compromise with negating yourself. The surrender that often has to occur in a relationship with a narcissist as “compromise” it can keep your submissive and fruitless behaviors and expectations alive. The red flags were made apparent within the first three months of the relationship. Everyone told me not to marry her or at least to wait a little longer. She was doing everything he had accused me of. Whenever she did not like how things were going, she would break up with me, and then take me back quickly.”



“When these red flags appeared early on, the narrative was “shaped” in a way that was at times romantic, passionate, and even practical. The old saying of “love is blind” applies here, and before these patterns set in, hope is often what allows people to look the other way when the red flags arise. Over time, the narratives become a bit more realistic, hope begins to fade, and it becomes brutally clear that these patterns of mistrust, anger, and deceit are here to stay. A human relationship should not be built on what you can do for someone, but simply on a mutual partnership. A narcissistic relationship can often devolve into superficial attributes, such as jobs, schools, titles, resources, addresses, photo-shopped images, status posts, quiet children, well-appointed homes, and possessions.”



“I felt like I was going to die, and I went into a deep depression. It took me years to get out of that fog. You need micro-changes you had to make to survive this relationship. Narcissistic partners are masterful at leaving someone feeling like they are doing something wrong. Fear of being alone often drives a person back into a relationship quickly. If you are going to give your partner these second chances, just make sure your expectations are in line with reality. It really comes down to your willingness to shift your focus out of the past and into the present and the future.”



“It takes so long to learn how to love but I think it starts with messing it up a few times.”



“I was still sad and heartbroken, desperately trying to get him back. But it only took one night with someone new who looked at me like I was pretty special to make me realise I had made a world out of one single person and that’s pretty limiting because, you know, the world is pretty limitless. There are people out there who will love you like you love them and all that jazz...”



“Gaslighting qualifies as a form of emotional abuse that involves denying a person’s experience and making statements, such as “that never happened,” “you’re too sensitive,” or “this isn’t that big a deal.”




“She was struggling to make ends meet, and he - the narcissist - had been at best marginally available to her. To an outsider it looked like a relationship of convenience. You only exist when you are useful.”



“Entitlement manifests across so many situations and scenarios, but it is often most visible when a person is dealing with service professionals (wait staff, flight attendants, hotel clerks, sales clerks, attendants in any situation where there are lines or waiting periods). Narcissistic people measure themselves on the basis of how they are treated by the outside world and expect special treatment.”



“When an accusation is thrown at you that does not fit you, when it doesn’t capture what you know to be true about yourself or your behavior, mentally flip it back on your partner. He is likely accusing you of what he is doing or feeling. Accusations can be about the narcissist’s own vulnerabilities and weaknesses (accusing you of being overly ambitious when he is ambitious, criticizing you for being unsuccessful or not making enough money when he is not feeling successful in that space)”



“The technical term that is often used for this is “interpersonally exploitative.” In short, because of the singular focus on fulfilling their needs, especially external needs, narcissists will use other people as objects to get those needs met. Other people often do serve literally as objects—a tool to get a job done. Because you are not in on this secret in the beginning, it can feel a bit depersonalizing—as though you are only valued when you are functional. It can feel manipulative, because your partner may compliment you excessively and then hit you with a difficult request or ask you to make uncomfortable requests.”



“Narcissists are manipulative and masterful at twisting the situation and working the rules to get what they want. Even more frustrating, they will turn things around in such a way that you may ultimately give them what they want and exhaust yourself in the process. Early in a relationship, the manipulation is most often emotional (“I had a tough childhood, so sometimes I say things I do not mean” or “I am under a lot of stress, so I blew up—I didn’t really mean it”) and financial (masterfully getting you to take on disproportionately more financial responsibility, finding yourself spending money you do not have to keep your relationship going and your partner happy.”



“Narcissists are also prone to something called projection, whereby they place their flaws and questionable behaviors on everyone else. Jealousy is often a great litmus test of whether or not your partner is actually the one cheating; if he starts accusing you of cheating out of the blue, you can bet the farm on the fact that if he is not already cheating, he is likely engaging in an inappropriate relationship.”



“Many times in new relationships the restructuring of boundaries can be hard work and requires mature and insightful communication. A common mistake is to assume that boundaries will just figure themselves out; they often do not, and hurt feelings are inevitable. For example, snuggle time with a male friend may evaporate once the woman enters into a committed relationship. Boundaries are usually implicit and understood by the persons in the relationship.”



“The rejection may be the familiar rejection of your parents. The dynamic of having to please all the time and run around in circles to get them to notice you, or never feeling like you are enough, is familiar and it likely started young. When that familiarity gets turned on in adulthood by a rejecting partner, it is strangely comforting—like a moment of déjà vu—which can make it feel almost magical. That old song of rejection is so familiar that we cannot get it out of our head. It is irrational, and because it is “magical” or chemical, the irrationality gets romanticized. Many people make many big mistakes in the name of chemistry. Enduring ongoing poor treatment in a relationship is the most common.”



“Show me your friends and I'll show you your future.”

“Sunset is as beautiful as sunrise. Why can't the endings be as beautiful as beginnings? Why do we fly in 7th heaven in the beginnings and fall to 7th hell in the endings? Why can't we stay at the ground?”

“PEOPLE
Kick them -- they'll forgive you. Flatter them -- they may or may not see through you.
But ignore, them, and they'll hate you, even if they conceal it until they die.”



“When it comes to love, narcissists are sprinters and not marathoners. It is often a rather grandiose experience, with numerous references to “falling in love at first sight,” and a “once-ina-lifetime” love story.”



“A self-confident person is often a good problem solver and stress manager, self-reflective and able to clearly observe, articulate, and take ownership of his faults and vulnerabilities. Because self-confident people have a wellformed sense of identity and values, they do not feel the need to disrespect other people, because they know who they are and do not feel threatened by other people or their views.”



“In the case of narcissistic personality disorder, it is an inability to form deep connections with others, superficiality, and a complete lack of a basic and necessary human quality: empathy.”



“It is hard to engage in listening to another person with empathy if you are waiting for the spotlight to shine back on you.”

“Loud blasts of emotion and invective with little regard for how words and actions affect other people are the norm.”



“The disconnect between the reality and the grandiose fantasy can make the narcissist angry, frustrated, sullen, and prone to lashing out. They are dreamers. When it comes to grandiosity and relationships is when narcissists talk about their “great love story” or the idea of an “ideal love.”



“Despite our financial struggles, he - the narcissist - would insist that we take lavish vacations, get $150 bottles of wine, and spare no expense. When the bills came in, he couldn’t be bothered, but he always expected the show to go on. Narcissists will tend to spend money they don’t have to throw a big show. One place this will sometimes emerge is in wedding planning. Many people I talked with reflected back on their weddings as though they were a “show”.”



“We most acutely experience this phenomenon of emotional coldness when we are going through something difficult ourselves, and the other person offers nothing.”



“When someone never takes responsibility for anything—words, actions, feelings—it is a challenging if not impossible way to maintain a relationship. They make up complex excuses and can rationalize anything. Be mindful as he shares the story of his life. Does he take ownership of past mistakes or missteps? Or does he share his history as though it were blameless and free of any errors on his part? Does he always seem to blame others for any negative situations in his life?”



“Many people in narcissistic relationships find that they start becoming more anxious and even less able to regulate their own moods, because they feel as though they are living in chaos—and there was nothing they could do about it, because they were unable to soothe, comfort, or cheer up their partner. Interestingly, because of the narcissist’s tendency to blame other people for their difficulties and engage in projection, they will often blame you for being unreliable and inconsistent, when it is in fact their moods that are all over the map.”



“Your vulnerable partner may frequently put himself down and sometimes respond to positive feedback, but, in general, he is chronically self-critical and may seem neglectful or dejected most of the time. It often looks like depression. If this is your partner, you may become aware of this pattern over time through the absolute sense of isolation, neglect, and disconnection that unfolds.”



“Vulnerable partners cannot (and do not want to) maintain the initial level of energy they brought to an earlier phase of your relationship, once they disengage it can be extremely frustrating for a partner.”



“Pop culture and love songs, in particular, can contribute to our belief that love is all about chemistry and insanity. It is when you are enduring careless, neglectful, unkind, and disconnected words and behavior from a partner, and falling back on “chemistry” as the rationale, that you need to take a long hard look at the idea of chemistry as a factor that may be imprisoning you in a one-sided, narcissistic relationship. Sometimes the good guys and gals get their opportunity once a person has already been through the wringer with a narcissist. After a person experiences the scorpion’s sting, the comfort of a kind person can become a soft and loving place to land.”



“You already put so much money into this machine (emotional energy), it has to pay out. You aren’t going to walk away, because what if the next person comes around and pulls the handle and hits the jackpot (the next woman he dates get the engagement ring)? A slot machine that pays out consistently every time you put money into it might get dull, perhaps like a kind, empathic person who is always there for you. It may not be about big jackpots after all, but rather about loving mutual regard, which is in fact the greatest jackpot of all.”



“Because they are manipulative, narcissists know how to spin a tale that will elicit your sympathy, make you want to help them, and also make it harder for you to criticize them or express your disapproval regarding certain behaviors. The narcissistic partner’s back story is frequently cited as a reason you kept trying to fight for the relationship. The back story often left you wanting to “rescue” him and to fix his past. You keep writing excuses instead of addressing the behavior that is taking a toll on you.”



“Wouldn’t narcissism be valuable from a Darwinian perspective? From an evolutionary perspective, the narcissist actually has the best plumage and appears to be the best mate. A purely evolutionary view does not account for what we know about the value of authenticity, self-regulation, discipline, loyalty, and community.”



“We need to rationalize our existences, usually by doing something that feels “important.” Our inner worlds are devalued, because others cannot directly observe them. Many people remain “do-ers.” Doing things to make up for their belief that they themselves are “not enough.” In relationships when your partner is not engaging in a mutual way, and you feel that the only way to keep the relationship afloat and to keep your partner content is to keep doing things—stay fit, look good, clean the house, make his life easy, buy her things— then that becomes your pattern. In addition, you may need to be yet another bringer of admiration into your partner’s life telling him,“you are so attractive/smart/successful/sexy/cool/awesome.” All this stuff you need to bring, day after day after day, can be labeled narcissistic supply. Psychologically healthy human beings nourish themselves from the inside. They do not “need” supply, and other people in their worlds should not be in the role of having to serve them that way. You may get some insight into why this relationship has been so exhausting.”



“You edit and modify your own books when you bring someone into your heart or life.It’s a gradual process of learning, compromise, and growth. How do you respond to love? To stress? To fear? To hope? What are your needs and wants? What are your vulnerabilities and what are your strengths? What do you expect from your partner? From a relationship? From life? What is your partner’s book? What patterns has he already shown that have given you a clear look into the Book of Him (or Her)? See your partner as a “whole” person. That does not mean, however, that you have to be his social worker or savior. You are not responsible for his histories, and you cannot rewrite them.”



“They shift the blame rather than taking the responsibility for their wrongs. Those under witchcraft’s control think they never do anything wrong. When caught they say there is nothing for which to repent. They tell you directly, “I haven’t done anything wrong” or “I did what I thought was right. I don’t have anything to feel sorry about.” They never manifest any true repentance or humility.”




“if i have never seen you cry.

“People who hurt you over and over again do not deserve to be a part of your life.”

“We use our eyes to see, but we use our voice to know.”



“A signal does not necessarily mean that you want to be located or described. It can mean that you want to be known as Unlocatable and Hidden.”



“After it happened I was at a loss for words. Haven't you said this yourself? Haven't you said this to a close friend who early in your friendship, when distracted, would call you by the name of her black housekeeper? You assumed you two were the only black people in her life. Eventually she stopped doing this, though she never acknowledged her slippage. And you never called her on it (why not?) and yet, you don't forget.”



“We May Disagree,
But Never Disrespect.
We May Love Each Other,
But Will Never Stop Loving

“When you have sexual relations with someone, for example, there is a soul tie (emotional bonding) that generates because two fleshes become one (Genesis 2:24). Sexual relations in marriage generate a healthy soul tie while sexual relations outside of marriage create unhealthy soul ties.”



“We have to be careful how we treat others. The human brain is a sensitive flesh that can be punctured by a single event. Based on your sentence, you can leave someone an insult they’ll never forget. You can sometimes hear this frailty when shy voices ask things like: “Can I have another bite?”, “Please call me back” or “What days do you work?”



“I think we all have to meet more people. Help others, be hurt by others, learn from them, fight with them, listen to them, and see things. Over time, one starts to develop a universal voice that is all-fitting— soothing to grandmas, yet exciting to kids. Loud enough to cheer in a stadium and soft enough to whisper in church. A voice that makes sense both to a hungry man on the street and a university professor. An experienced body breeds an encompassing voice.”



“We cannot know everything. We cannot do everything. We are what we chose to have known. We are what we ended up doing. This condition is why you could look around and tell people apart. Time is ticking and we are all fugitives fleeing from random death. And we all flee differently. Thus, with the responsibility of choice, humanity is magical this way.”



“We meant to each other The way trophies do: On the day of.”



“The pressure of following traditions blindly only resorts in one not being able to experience their most vivid prospects.”

“Estimates vary as to how much a couple’s time together declines, but the most commonly cited study says it drops by two-thirds once a child is born. The nature of this time together changes dramatically too.”

“She doesn’t date. She understands how the dating arrangement works for other people, but finds the idea illogical for her own circumstances. Dates, as opposed to catching up with friends, assume that one is available and interested in some sort of a connection ranging from casual sex to marriage and including everything in between. Firstly, she doesn’t feel single. She doesn’t feel alone, and so the idea of searching for some person to fill a space doesn’t make sense to her. Secondly, she reads most people very quickly. The thought of dating a stranger in an awkward, draining, and undetermined situation to find out what sort of person they are, even though it is usually obvious, makes her cringe.”



“No relationship is by accident; especially our most bonded relationships. Chance plays no role in the unfolding of our lives. Every relationship automatically pushes towards its own evolution. Each carries its own lessons and purpose. None will fail to fulfil their healing function. It may seem that they can fail and, sometimes, fail abysmally. However, healing is inevitable and simply a matter of time. From the perspective of the Divine, time is insubstantial and so healing is already present, even if not already obvious.”



“Have you ever felt that one of your friends or relatives tried to isolate you from others? Do you know anyone who gets super spiritual when you try to have a normal conversation? Is this person always telling you what God told them that He wants you to do? Have you lost close friends because someone began to talk spitefully about them? Has anyone pitted two of your friends against each other? Is there anyone who releases fear at you whenever they want you to do something? Has anyone ever told you something terrible was going to happen to you if you didn’t do what he or she said?”



“Witchcraft drains the life (energy) right out of you. When attacked, you feel tired, depressed, oppressed and fatigued.”



“Witchcraft controllers spend abnormal amounts of time with their victims: The girl that consumes all her friend’s spare time. The boy that smothers his girlfriend with inordinate attention. Witchcraft will go out of the way to control and waste your time. It’s not a natural thing it’s a spiritual thing. Scripture says “Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbor’s house lest he be weary of thee and so hate thee” (Proverbs 25:17).”



“If your emotions can be hooked, then they can gain a soul tie with you. If they can form a soul tie with you then they can control you. All abnormal soul ties need to be broken by the power of the Name of Jesus.”



“People believe that separation opens their eyes to their self-defeating behaviors and gives them an opportunity to resolve those problems with a new partner. But unless they under- stand the unconscious desires that motivated their dysfunctional behavior in the first relationship and learn how to satisfy those desires with the new partner, the second relationship is destined to run aground on the same submerged rocks.”



“Ladies, stop thinking in terms of your sexual market value (femininity) and start thinking in terms of your sensual market value (feminine).”

“Truth is, it’s not love but femininity that costs you. Femininity has a price, love is free.”

“Marriage is an institution for the paralysis of the sexual instinct.”

“She saw beauty in everything but herself. Abuse can be like that.”

“It's not youh, it's meh.”

“Met je dood eindigt het leven, maar nooit de relatie die je met iemand hebt. Onze relaties sterven nooit, onze lichamen sterven. Je kinderen blijven je kinderen, je partner blijft je partner en je vrienden blijven je vrienden, ook al is je leven ten einde. Sterven is verhuizen naar he hart van de mensen die je dierbaar zijn,”



“Trust and believe, If my heart gets broken; I am really the only one to blame because, my fall-back and pull out game !!!!!!!!!!! that shit is insane.”

“A mother is your first friend, your best friend, your forever friend.”




“What's your type?' she asked.
'Well, the right person wouldn't need to know.”



“People don't judge you by your beliefs, they judge you by your behavior.”



“To children their mother's sight is like a hug and their mother's smile is like a kiss.”



“Be the kind of a friend you would like to be with.”



“Sometimes the one we want to share our secrets with becomes our secret.”



“You claim to want love, but how can that be if you have not yet met the person you love? Rather, you desire its advantages: touch, security, and company. Love is born from another person—their touch, their company, their ideas. Love is a hand that knocks on our doors and owns no door of its own for you to knock on. When dealing with people, we are each too unique and changing to be labeled and be fitted to another person’s prerequisite needs. And so, it is our lovers who introduce us to our desire. Until then, it is not love that we want. If we claim, alone in our homes, to so badly want love, or marriage, we likely want that other thing.”



“The best lover you could ever have will sit on this very bench 270 years from now. You two will never meet. And will never know you’ll never meet. They are, however, currently sitting with you because if you two did meet, you’d spend your time sitting as you are now. Because returning to that bench every afternoon, happily single, was like spending a day with every soul who wants to sit there too.”



“Why in the world would you want somebody that doesn't want you? It's just that simple. Move on.”

“The girls... they always drift off and say they gotta find themselves first. But we never find ourselves. We find other people... and ask for another day with them.”



“I hate running into people. They take the random places. That door over there. Fuck that door. It was an hour before class on the first day and Justin came out right as I was walking in. Bumped in and scared the ba- Jesus out of me and every time I walked into that door, I remembered him. For four years that space belonged to that moment. It’s like everywhere we walk, all we see internally is a landmark of people and moments you’ll never have again.”



“It was agreed that to stay with one person your whole life was to not only prevent life experience, but have a miserable elder life by having to stay with another ugly old-looking person. If you stayed single forever, however, one wouldn’t have to lie and say to their wrinkly, crooked-backed lover, “Good morning, beautiful.” Thus, everyone pretty much died alone. At least they died honestly. But these people did not live honestly. At some point, every person once wished to tell that morning lie—to be soothed and supported by an unconditional, unwavering agreement during the cold ends of one’s life. A lie of attraction in exchange for company, they theorized. But they missed the point. Marriage in one’s elder life isn’t to lie and say, “Good morning, beautiful,” but to joke and say, “Good morning, ugly.”



“The thing about awkward people was that they made so many mistakes, you could make your own around them. They wouldn’t ding you for it. From their presence, you could be yourself around them and simply release. It was strangely relieving being around someone who made you uncomfortable. Not only were they interesting to watch, but you could do just about anything with them. It was as if some bodies were made of an all-purpose fiber that excluded no activity from its nature.”



“The entire object of true relationships is to make people not merely do or say the right thing, but to enjoy saying and doing the right things; not merely to like, but to enjoy being admired, and not merely to love, but to love unconditionally and all their flaws.”

“That day, at chapel, another student raised her hand. She asked, "Looking back on your twenties, what would you most want to say to those of us who are going through our twenties now?" I made eye contact briefly with Yuseon, who was seated amongst the other students, as I looked over at the student who had asked the question. She must have been shy because her voice trembled. Without even having to think about it, I said, "I hope you all have someone who always makes you want to say, Let's remember this day forever." The students oohed and aahed, and then laughed at each other's reaction. I laughed with them. "Also..." They'd thought I was done but they quieted down again. "I hope you will never hesitate to say, I'll be right there.”



“Obedience to Christ is not a burden to bear. Instead it points the way to being truly human—an unfettered conscience, an unhindered nearness to him, and the pleasure of his hospitality and protection.”



“Oh, it definitely sucked,” replied Akshay. And of course it will suck. All things sucked when you were trying to get along with someone. Even if something didn’t actually suck, it sucked when you were talking about it, as if the only way to secure a bond was to clutch at something troublesome. Often this looks like faking tiredness to fit in. Finding negativity is like discovering the perfect mask for the masquerade ball you’re about to attend. One can always hate. It is accessible. What we love is embarrassing.”



“Humans were walking wounds and sometimes, they shared.”



“In the kitchen, their mind volumes were so loud that they were having entire conversations with the way they sniffled, cleared their throats, and the foot trails of effort not to get into the other’s way when crossing to the sink.”



“We are doomed, but fortunately, there are holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries that help. We never want to love. We only love, so thank God for dates that make us want.”



“Pretty faces have distracted incoming hands ready to stab. Sex has disguised arguments. Politeness has prevented confrontation. Laughing has slowed down revelation. Emotions have been misinterpreted as agreements. Judgment has hampered our listening. Perhaps, for now, we are more accurately defined by what we say or think and not how we seem or look.”



“Maybe those relationships cracked for a reason—to let the light in.”



“As long as you're feeding it milk, even a snakelet may behave like kitten. You have to stop feeding it milk to know what it really is.”

“Friends?'
The word seemed cheap... It was never going to fully describe what we were to each other. But that wasn't what the word was doing right then. It wasn't a definition; it was a boundary. One I needed to accept.
'Friends.”



“Before you speak ask yourself if what you are going to say is true, is kind, is necessary, is helpful. If the answer is no, maybe what you are about to say should be left unsaid.”

“You don't accept them because they love you,
You accept them because they love God,
Their love for God is your greatest insurance.”

“Relationships should not be transactionally bound.”

“In a moving world filled with endless distractions, time is the most valuable currency. When someone gives you theirs, they cut a slice of their life span and serve it to you. In their brief existence, in their undeterminable episode of consciousness, you were chosen. And the equation goes: with others, you mean.”



“Health means different things to different people, but it’s always associated with a certain level of freedom—especially financial and temporal—that allows people to live well, and to focus on relationships and meaningful work.”



“Despite the fact that the world is a very dark place, and that each of us has our black elements of soul, we see in each other a unique blend of actuality and possibility that is a kind of miracle: one that can manifest itself, truly, in the world, in the relationships we have that are grounded in trust and love.”



“You know more about someone at the end of relationship than during the relationship.”




“It's a lesson too late for the learning,
made of sand, made of sand.
In the wink of an eye my soul is turning,
in your hands, in your hands.
Are you going away, with no word of farewell,
will there be not a trace left behind?
I could of loved you better,
didn't mean to be unkind.
You know it was the last thing on my mind.”



“There is a reason to love -
and it is more important each day.”

“The worst way to get over someone is to be with someone else immediately.”

“Almost everyone who has been into various relationship has someone whom they can call at 2 in the night for their carnal cravings.”

“In the meadow, I had Kellen all to myself. He smelled good. Sweat and motorcycle and wintergreen. No stinking weed smoke. No perfume. No sadness. He smelled like love. Between the cottonwoods and the bluff, I spread out the quilt and offered him the cans of beer.”



“If someone leaves you never thought of losing, someone better comes you never thought of having.”



“You were too late to be my first, but I badly want you to be my last.”



“It was not your love that lacked intensity, it was the person that lacked quality.”



“Broken heart doesn't bleed, it cries.”



“There are some relationships that will never be what you want them to be. Instead of pining for them to repair, ask yourself, do you really relate to the people in question? If the answer is no, just let go and move on. When there is no relating between two people, the label of the relationship is irrelevant. In fact, when you don’t or can’t relate to someone, what is the point in clinging on to a dead relationship?”

“The sharpest sword in all of creation is useless, if there’s nothing to swing at but air.”



“Every lip you kiss will start a different story in you.”

“Nobody misses hugs and kisses of their ex, they miss the warmth, they miss the song, they miss how they make you feel about yourself. That’s what they miss.”

“In any relationship things will get hard, it will get messy too, your opinions about each other will change. People who know them will say something they don’t like. Everything can and will happen. The only thing you need to remember is you love them, and they love you back. No other reason matters enough.”

“Maybe you're meant to be with her, maybe she is meant to be with you. Maybe the world isn't as dark as it may seem. Maybe.”

“At some point you need to stop jumping the chasm for people who wouldn't jump a pothole for you.”



“Sometimes there is no good reason why you stop talking to someone. You don’t know how you don’t know why.”

“All I need is a heads up before you decide to leave, is that too much to ask for?”

“To make the relationship work, someone has to provide discipline and someone has to provide commitment.”

“Sometimes it's better to have someone even when it hurts badly.”

“Darling, don’t say it’s me that you love,
But that you love how I make you feel on the weekends.
Don’t say you have to go, admit there’s nothing more to let me know.
Don’t say it was a good movie, tell me that it was a good break.
Don’t say you like her hair, tell me that it’s just different.
Don’t say your father’s evil, tell me that it’s ignorance.
Don’t say you feel like dying, tell me life would be better without bills.
Don’t say you hate crying, but that you hate when they see you ill.
Don’t say you love the winter, tell me you like the gifts.
Don’t say you want a vacation when you really want a kiss.”



“Per-haps every can of cashews has a fake snake lurking, but you keep opening them, stupidly, because in your heart of hearts you still believe in cashews.”



“وفي محاولاتي لتجاوزك
تجاوزات أصدقائي..
وعائلتي..
وأحلامي..
وحياتي..
وحتى نفسي..
وها أنا ذا أجلس في غرفتي وحدي، أكتب لك أنني لم أستطع تجاوزك!”

“Thank you for making me miss you, for the hole in my heart, for the tears on this napkin. You make me want to hurt for a new person. I guess that’s all we can ever ask for.”



“I can’t do relationships because I’m afraid it will get boring. My friendships are boring. And married couples only talk about how to upgrade the house. I don’t want you and I to be bored ever and so I don’t want to ruin that. People aren’t meant to be so close to each other," said Andrew.
"Andrew," said Nora. "There are some people you meet who are worth being boring with.”



“We tend to chew life into pieces to make it easier for us to swallow, but the challenge is to know that life is a jawbreaker and to be fair to the things we experience, you have to gulp. Especially people.”



“He smiled, put his hands on the back of her neck, fingers in her hair, and leaned in to press his forehead against hers. He'd told her before that he did it to take away half her sadness, half her headache, half her nerves before her Columbia interview. Because half less of a bad thing meant there was room for half good.”

“Expectations hurt more than enemies.”



“m walkin’ down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I’m bound, I can’t tell
But goodbye’s too good a word, gal
So I’ll just say fare thee well
I ain’t sayin’ you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don’t mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don’t think twice, it’s all right”



“Be close to those who can hear you when you are far.”

“Grandparents enjoy most the company of their grandchildren. For with them, they experience the miracle of being 10 again.”

“One day I will also cover the shroud , Every relationship will be broken from this land, irritate me as much as you can,one day I will Leave you crying all the day.”

“End of summer
comes falling like a waterfall of midnight stars
and I'm crawling out of this
nymphal skeleton
leaving you
like cicada do”




“And then one goes on to the next. Because love is all rot, you know”



“Find ways to make her happy without spending money. It's economical and more effective in the long run.”

“Love is neither aggressive nor dramatic, love is raw.”

“The greatest bond doesn't happen over a coffee shop, it happens when you're talking to them in a half asleep state.”

“When you see them in your dream, and your body shivers and your heart aches. When the fear of seeing them again pounds on your numb brain and you can't sleep anymore. When you go through that, then tell me what is love and what is separation.”

“The crappy yet popular way to measure the quality of your relationship is how much money you throw at each other.”

“Never confront someone when they're sleeping, chances are they'll slap at your face and go back to sleep.”

“For some people talking to their ex’s is no big deal, for some people it’s the last thing on their bucket list.”

“Your ex is your best teacher. Because the lessons they'll teach you would be far more important than what you have learned from school.”

“Her coming there like that, to talk to me, it meant something.
Before anybody else could say something stupid, Wavy put her lips to my ear and said, “Come into the meadow.”



“Punch yourself in the face if you think to rekindle old flames and probably even then that punch would hurt less.”

“Thinking to rekindle old flames of lust? I won't stop you, nobody can. The only way you'll learn is by burning again and again.”

“Don't let her love come in a way of you becoming a great man.”

“Your relationship may be new or old but without adjustment you cannot pass a day without argument.”

“The quality of a relationship can never be limited by the number of days you’ve spent together.”

“When you go above and beyond to do something for someone that you’re not obligated to, you form a massive respect that stays lifetime.”

“What to do when you want to hold something badly, but you have to end it at the same time?”

“Remembering your exes once in a while is okay, but taking actions on those reminiscing memories could be dangerous.”

“How will you differentiate between cold feet and actual fear? What if you misunderstood and then you can’t take a step back?”

“Tą dieną man pirmą dingtelėjo, kad suaugusieji yra tarpusavyje sudarę sąmokslą prieš vaikus. Užtenka jiems pasakyti žodį, ir vaikas pasmerktas. Tada jau niekas tau nebepadės: nei tavo galios ašaros, bei nuoširdžiausi prisiekinėjimai. Suaugusieji paprasčiausiai nekreipia į tai dėmesio...”



“Visi žmonės daro šitą klaidą. Dažniausiai savo švelnumą slepiame, neparodome jo artimam žmogui, tuo tarpu piktą ir užgaulų žodį neretai teškiame kitam į veidą. O juk reiktų daryti atvirkščiai.”



“The most important thing was something that I saw when I saw them for dinner that evening and what I still see today - it's the way they look at each other, the way they act around each other. They make each other happy. They love each other. They are good to each other. As long as you make each other happy, as long as you are good to one another, he is everything I could ever want.”



“How hard it is to understand that some people do not want to be with you regardless what you have done or what you haven’t.”

“What better way to wake up than wake up with the voice you love?”

“What could be better than two broken people trying to heal each other with no strings attached.”

“Sometimes you miss their sense of humour more than their romantic words.”

“What does it mean to "cast shade" on your friend? It's when you try to spot their weaknesses, shortcomings or insecurities in any given situation in order to act in the more favourable or popular way, so that you can shine in the eyes of others. Example: Your friend is under sudden, aggressive criticism; instead of helping her out of it, you throw her under the bus by siding with her critics. Another example: your friend has social anxiety; you spot this as an opportunity to be "the fun one" and deliberately, maliciously try to be outgoing and joyful even when you're not genuinely feeling that way. Outshining someone by virtue of deliberate comparison to their vulnerable spots: that is casting shade.”

“Per un momento sono semplicemente e completamente felici. Ci sono, proprio adesso, e sono riuscite, in qualche modo, nel corso di diciotto anni, a continuare ad amarsi. È abbastanza. In questo momento è abbastanza.”




“Even when you loved them, people were unknowable.”



“It was emotionally controlling but physically I was free.
I felt however like a sweet little doll in a doll house.
I decorated our home like we were in a doll house.
I lost myself in that little doll house.
And I lost myself in the sweet girl that I was.
The more I become a woman, the more we drifted apart.”

“I truly believe gratitude is the key to being happy in general. If you aren't grateful every day for what you have, you can't know true happiness. Life is hard, and not everything that comes our way brings us joy. If we choose to focus on the hardships and sadness, we're in for one long and miserable life! Every day we must choose to find happiness. See it when it is in front of you. Look for it within what you have. And every day that we choose to stay in a relationship, we have to recognize the good it brings to our lives. We have to be grateful for what we have.”



“This may seem frivolous at first but actually has value— the choice to love is not a feeling; it is an action. Once you truly understand such concept you will also understand there is no such thing as "the wrong time".”

“How casually people say 'Love You' these days
Please say it only when you really mean it.
Do not add it to list of Sorry and Thank you which people rarely mean..”

“We expect so much of love. And yet, like all of us, it can falter and it can fail. Mary has learned the hard way that love cannot always save the day. But it may well still show us how to save ourselves.”



“Unrequited love belongs to one person. Really being in love with another person requires the two of you. It can’t be willed to exist from one person alone, and therefore, it is not something any one person can control. And that’s why it’s so f*cking terrifying.”



“The edges of our heart
hold the most beautiful memories.”

“As a couple, it's not 'your' problem or 'my' problem, it's always 'our' problem. Because one way or the other it's going to affect you both.”

“After every couple of weeks, we should pay close attention to how we speak with those close to us. Introspection is the only way to improve.”

“Giving people enough time without being passive-aggressive is one of the good ways to salvage your relationship.”

“I think everyone should learn how to just miss them and do nothing about it.”

“It's about how we've both been the worst and we're still trying our best.”



“Nobody should have that kind of power over someone where they destroy their day by merely not replying.”

“Don’t let the grudges you hold become a constant reason you fight.”

“You don't leave your relationship in the middle and hope it gets better on its own. You've to work on it, and you've to do it hard.”

“The ability to let go without resenting will keep your relation fresh for a long time.”

“Talking about your present lover with your previous lover, what kind of zone is that?”

“The relationship which is based on trust doesn’t involve telling each other with whom they can talk and with whom they can not.”

“Never hold a grudge for more than a day, and there will never be a problem you can’t solve.”

“Is it okay to love someone new while still healing from the last person you loved?”

“How long you need to wait before it's okay to fall in love again?”

“You’ll rarely have a relationship problem if you listen with an open perspective and closed mouth.”

“Relationships should always be handled carefully. Sex is one thing – throw your bodies together, wake up the next day – but if you want to really know someone, it’s best to remember that while you look like skin, people are glass on the inside. You have to be careful.”



“Ignoring people and still craving their attention is a different level of stupidness.”

“Why do people let their lives be eaten up by boring jobs and unsatisfying relationships?”

“First we allow them, then we complain when they do it again. Don’t entertain what you don’t like, no matter how hard you want to impress them.”

“Don’t be angry when your partner texts back their ex, because one day you’ll be their ex and you’ll be happy when they text back to you. Modern problem require modern solutions.”

“We have each other and for all I know that's what hope is.”




“This person that now keeps you safe will one day talk to you from behind a dark wall of something you cannot understand and you will stamp your feet for a while, for a year, until you give up. You will let your arms fall down, close your mouth, close your eyes, turn around and walk away.
It will happen again and again.”



“I kept looking at her. It was mountains, weather, or her — I didn’t know. But I felt a lot of feelings as she read my words, bending over the bed, facing me, and occasionally looking at me between those five pages.”



“Men and women are born incomplete, and need each other to become whole. They are born with complimentary qualities and characteristics. Each one needs the other to fulfill his or her human destiny.”



“I asked students once: "Why do you feel that the regard I extend to a particular student cannot also be extended to each of you? Why do you think there is not enough love or care to go around?”



“When you feel secure, you can be the best version of yourself. Insecurity brings out the worst version of you.”

“The best parts of life come from being connected.”



“Isabel had seen it happen to geniuses at her own high school, at Yale, and at NASA. Their talent for problem-solving brought them attention, and to some, that felt like love. So they threw themselves into their careers, leading more and more solitary lives, and taking on bigger and bigger professional challenges until--on the other side of that breakthrough--there was no one waiting for them to come back home. The love they had poured into their work, expecting it to boomerang back, never came back.”



“The least understood, most important thing in the world is love.”



“Some break their hearts themselves
to be healed of the wrong love.”

“I've met people who say they don't want relationships; but it's not the relationships that they don't want: it is the mundane dynamic that is named the "relationship", which they despise. The struggle for control; the humdrum motions recycled by a billion other couples; the low rhythm that seems to cycle, repeating its monotonous hymn through the myriad crowds. They want to find someone and feel every vein in their body connect to that person, they want to fly with someone, they want what's natural; they want a partner. It's a partner they want. Not a "relationship"; but a partner. A whole other person who wants to stay with their own whole person. They want something meant for them, or nothing at all.”

“What's life without love?
Hell.”

“It's just- well, I don't want you to get hurt. Take it slow, that's my advice. Look, you're new to this, and it takes some experience dealing with..." Her sentence trailed off. "I mean, what do you really know about him?"
"Well, he's not married.”



“Give room for peace, for a love that caters, not one that batters.”



“If we never have enough love, we have more than most.”



“You’ve punctured my solitude, I told you. It had been a useful solitude, constructed, as it was, around a recent sobriety, long walks to and from the Y through the sordid, bougainvillea-strewn back streets of Hollywood, evening drives up and down Mulholland to kill the long nights, and, of course, maniacal bouts of writing, learning to address no one. But the time for its puncturing had come. I feel I can give you everything without giving myself away, I whispered in your basement bed. If one does one’s solitude right, this is the prize.”



“revolution cannot be created by conforming to existing roles in relationships already defined by the systems we want to overthrow.”



“Expression of the bygone
All relationships are going to end naturally or not. It is all up to you and what you want, I choose to stay in this relationship forever, and doing it is too difficult sometimes. Just remember you have choices in life. So, what are you going to listen to? Your inner voice or the ones that are all around you and me?
It is just like we all needed to get off the cyber walls and take our life’s back. The webbed walls were doing nothing but showing names with faces that label others with either good or bad stigmas, it could not be deleted, and it would follow you everywhere you went… even if you had a past that was made up by someone else it remained with you. It needed to end; it was ripping the world apart. I still believe that we all need to find real friends in person if you can in this day and age, we should not spend all of our free time looking at faces on a screen, that are deceiving what true thoughts of friendship should stand for. Please remember they are not your so-called friends… they are not your friends on there at all, if you do not or cannot talk to them in real life.
Then what in the hell makes, you think you can chat with them on the webbed walls of the internet, and not real life? They are just there to look into your business, so stop being stupid. They do not care about you at all. They are stopping you from achieving your desires in your life, by talking or chatting behind your back, and how do you truly know what they are saying if you are blocked out, or who it is that is saying it. They do not care about you! So, I ask why should you care about them by having them on a profile or friends list; it is useless and completely immature?”



“The more you care about someone, the more likely is that your eventual parting of ways will be as sudden as it is baffling.”



“It doesn't matter," I say, and I start to pick up the broken glass shards. "I knew it would happen."
"Then why you don't stop it?" asks my mother.
And it's such a simple question.”



“He started to explain his position, trying to get me to engage. I secretly shut my heart to him completely. I forgot that this hurts only me.”



“For the sake of peace she choose silence.... now daggers have been sharpened for the upcoming violence”

“There was a time when you could drink water directly from lakes and rivers. Now you've to filter it. Same with people. You will always get dirt while dealing with people. You have to install a filter in your head.”

“In undergrad, I started to care more about my relationship--well, one in particular--and people thought I wasn't reaching my potential. I never liked how that was framed, as if it's a trade-off between love and work. Love enhances everything.”



“Making room in our heart for our own pain, we make room in our heart for theirs.”



“They loved Ender too, and knew him too; but in their grief, they leaned upon each other, a family that had strength to share because Ender had been part of them and healed them, or at least opened up the door of healing.”



“Hearing you say "I love you" has become cyclical
With future hypotheticals
Seem loving me is optional or even conditional.
But always remember mi amor; my love is reciprocal”

“Don’t let the scars on your heart
define the way you love.”

“I’m not saying that good men aren’t available. I am strongly stating that the misconception that all women need to have the fairy tale life by means of a rescuing man is archaic.”

“Too many relationships and marriages were working because they had parties to go to, weddings to attend, vacations to splurge on, other couples to compete with and people to impress. But now these couples have to sit in front of each other in a world that's ending and rebirthing as something entirely different, and they're realising, that when all those factors are taken away, the person in front of them is someone they don't even like. Friedrich Nietzsche once said, "Invisible threads are the strongest ties" and couples today are comprehending, that they don't have those threads. They only had the visible ones.”

“The little things do matter...unless it's a dick”

“He's not worth the pieces of my soap”

“Listen to a woman when she tells you how she wants it”

“When you've been stuck with each other long enough it can seem like there's no difference between no longer arguing and no longer caring.”




“You have to move on. You can't hold onto something that was never there”

“Trust the process”

“If the vets such as yourself aren't around to regulate the lifestyle, then how do you expect the fuck shit to stop”

“You think she belongs to you? She doesn't. It's just your turn”

“We lived a moment without wishes.”



“From these assumptions [that there is someone out there who is perfect, and that there is someone out there who is perfect for me], you are deriving at least three errors, which is quite an accomplishment given that you have made only two assumptions. To begin with, there is not anyone out there who is perfect. There are just people out there who are damaged, quite severely, although not always irreparably, and with a fair bit of individual idiosyncrasy. Apart from that, if there was someone out there who was perfect, they would take one look at you and run away screaming! Unless you are deceiving someone, why would you end up with anyone better than you? You should be truly terrified if you have been accepted as a date. A sensible person would think of their new potential romantic partner, 'Oh my God! You are either blind, desperate, or as damaged as me!' That is a horrifying idea- signing up with someone who is at least as much trouble as you. It is by no means as bad as being along with yourself, but it is still out of the frying pan and into the fire, although at least the fire might transform you. Thus, you get married, if you have any courage, if you have any longterm vision and to vow and adopt responsibility, if you have any maturity; and you start to transform the two of you into one reasonable person. And it is even the case that participating in such a dubious process makes the two of you into one reasonable person with the possibility of some growth. So, you talk. About everything. No matter how painful. And you make peace. And you thank Providence if you manage it, because strife is the default condition.”



“See others as yourself.
See families as your family.
See towns as your town.
See countries as your country.
See worlds as your world.
How do I know that the world is such?
By this.”

“Know others by knowing yourself.”

“I observe myself and thus understand the others.”

“I take care of home first, but I want a new Mandingo the same way he wants new Ms Phat Booty”

“Today is a good day to fuck somebody's husband”

“Black is strong, powerful and beautiful”

“You gotta snatch the crown and take the throne if you want to be the king”

“The dating pool is filled with hot dog water”

“I didn't cheat...I was smart”

“I don't have friends in the lifestyle. I go to parties to fuck and go home”

“I'm gonna bust this nut (in you) so good, that your husband is gonna taste my lunch when he eats your pussy”

“The worst thing a divorce does to a person isn't that it makes all the time you devoted to the relationship feel wasted, but it steals all the plans you had for the future.”



“You're too pretty to beg for dick”

“Since when raw sex meant we have something special?”

“My body count ends in 'grown as fuck”

“You don’t do anything. Cosmic law, remember? Like attracts like. Just be who you are, calm and clear and bright. Automatically, as we shine who we are, asking ourselves every minute is this what I really want to do, doing it only when we answer yes, automatically that turns away those who have nothing to learn from who we are and attracts those who do, and from whom we have to learn, as well.”



“The ego will say in its dying defence that, without it, we will be nothing and that, as faulty as it is, it is better than nothing. Put it down anyway. Just for a moment. Look at yourself honestly. Try to speak truthfully to those around you. Do not be afraid to be disliked or misunderstood. Believe that there are wonderful things in life that are waiting for you.”



“He [Jeremiah] felt all at one overwhelmed by the greatest gift that God can grant to a human being -- another human being. The world might rush to the abyss and nothing stay its course, but for him and his bride there was room enough on the edge of the precipice to build a house and live in it in peace. He could not prevent the downfall of Israel without being shattered himself...but he and Zenua could turn two hearts towards the Lord in their own house. amidst the general collapse they could continue to serve the Lord and listen with ears that would grow ever more attuned. Was this not enough for one of God's dreamers who had not been equipped with the toughness necessary for a fighter?”



“Cooking food creates some waste in kitchen. Eating it creates waste in body. Every action in life creates waste. Keep disposing it off. Holding onto it will make you sick.”

“The natural universal equation tells us if you plant a seed, water it, and take care of it, you reap its fruit. When you initiate the course, it is awesome. If otherwise, then at least try to be part of the equation so that you have a share in its fruit. Most of the time if not all, the fruits you reap are enormous and not measurable compared to the input(s) from your side.”



“She had shrunk for him and he still hadn't found the space he needed. No more.”




“It felt like I always wanted him, even before I knew him. He was the dream I couldn't explain in words but always knew it existed deep down within me. It was only when I found that dream breathing in a person that I realized that he was what I was looking for all this while.”



“Life was a game, a pastime, and death: it didn't exist. We laughed at everything, even at death, and that wasn't completely wrong, laughter always had the last word, the skull's grin when one day we lay there with earth in our mouths.”



“Always take the hand that's dealt, and play it like you wanted it”

“I couldn't think of anything except him. I didn't want to be anyone except his. I didn't want to do anything except be with him. I looked at other things but I was lost in his thoughts. Nothing except him made me happy anymore. Nothing except him made me sad anymore. I felt only him.”



“Regarding each other as the king and queen of your world provides a strong foundation for mutual support as your personal transformations unfold.”



“We coined the term "HeartWise" as a double entendre. One meaning is emotional--with regard to matters of the heart, such as love, compassion, gratitude, and joy. The second meaning relates to practical heart wisdom--an evolving process that transcends intellectual knowledge.”



“Bending the (Conventional) Rules: As a couple you mutually create your own guidelines and agreements, which remain fluid, subject to change as needed or desired. No topic is off limits, and you are willing to risk sharing your inner secrets. You are willing to stretch your comfort zones to get to know each other more intimately.”



“Communicating--the act of speaking and listening--has its own rhythm, its own dance steps. You and your partner each have your own style. Are you dancing together?....Are you always the leader in the dance or are you often
a follower? Are you timid and afraid of stepping on your partner's toes or do you gracefully flow and glide together across the dance floor of life?”



“Life’s too short to dread five days a week to only enjoy the remaining two.”



“Being in love is insanely vulnerable. You’re walking up to a person, ripping open your chest, exposing your heart, and asking them not to stab it. It takes courage to give someone the ability to know you completely and to crush you undeniably.”



“Accept what’s in front of you or go stand somewhere else.”



“Don’t peek through a window and assume you’re seeing the whole house.”



“She showed no remorse when he played both sides against the middle. She didn't shed a tear when his ego assumed she'd always be near. She remained strong. He grew weak. He knew the end was near. She gave him firm warning. He snickered and jeered. She laughed as she walked away never to reappear. She remained steadfast. He furiously tried to grasp remnants of her soul essence clutching to fear. His spark has now disappeared. Now he sits on the sidelines watching, wishing she were near. She can feel him tug at her soul fighting to have control. He has yet to determine how to become whole.”

“She told me to stop trying to save her. So I converted her to a low-risk certificate of deposit and enjoyed a significantly higher interest rate.”

“I dig in; but not before catching my squatting figure in the mirror, that gleaming mirage; so like my father from this distance I stop chewing, analysing hardened cheekbones and vacant eyes; a son long abandoned by his father (forced to move out, as a young adult, on account of his sexuality) now his father's diminutive likeness; an ironic narrative about genetics and its unfunny punch line, since I offer no spring of my own to further the tale; no passing on of love's disavowal either; how cool the noodles taste in my mouth, unmemorable yet oddly reassuring...”



“...I dig in; but not before catching my squatting figure in the mirror, that gleaming mirage; so like my father from this distance I stop chewing, analysing hardened cheekbones and vacant eyes; a son long abandoned by his father (forced to move out, as a young adult, on account of his sexuality) now his father's diminutive likeness; an ironic narrative about genetics and its unfunny punch line, since I offer no offspring of my own to further the tale; no passing on of love's disavowal either; how cool the noodles taste in my mouth, unmemorable yet oddly reassuring...”



“There was no love that I could see or feel between the men and the women; only boredom. Yet, paradoxically, I could also tell that this was what everyone wanted: a family structure they could be unhappy in; at least it formed the basis of a stable home, a baseline to a life that would otherwise not be tethered to anything.”



“Don't pick the lawyer who knows the law, pick the lawyer who does lunch with the judge”

“I love you. These bitches don't. They'll fuck you raw behind my back and burn your ass just so you can give it to me”

“Money is how men keep score”

“I'm not popular - they just want to fuck me”

“There's no statue of limitation for an asswhooping”

“Be careful...she's a mosquito with butterfly wings”

“Do you know where I can find good dick? These men be giving me pussy”

“Kings bring sand to the beach and build castles”

“I think people with STDs should glow in the dark”

“If I can't trust a man with my wife, I won't trust him with my life”

“I can't bribe my vagina to get wet for you”

“Other people keep you sane. That is part of why it is a good idea to get married. Why? Well, you are half insane. And so is your spouse. Well, maybe not half; but plenty. Hopefully, however, it is not generally the same half. Now and then you meet couples who have the same weakness, and then they compound that failing in each other. ... It is a fortunate happenstance, generally speaking, that your idiosyncrasies are likely to be somewhat randomly distributed, and that if you unite with someone else, you are likely to find some strength where you are weak, and vice versa. When you unite the two of you to create that original 'divine being' (that is the symbolic idea), then you have a chance of producing one reasonable, sane being. That is good for you both, even better for your children, who now have a fighting chance of adapting to what constitutes generally sane behavior; and it is good for friendship and the broader world, too.”



“If you are upset by someone's behaviour, this only means that you have to work on yourself before you try to correct the other person.”




“We are trying to divide the cake, which is not even baked.”



“This is a story about love and how not to love and sometimes exactly how to love, but mostly how to love something other than your love for another person because in the end you have to save yourself. And when the love is gone you must have love left for your own life. You must place that love in something more solid than a fleeting person, because when it’s gone you have to have love left for life.”



“If you can win an argument with a smile, why open your mouth and lose it.”



“I can spend a lifetime like this, just sitting here with you like this.”



“women are proto-psychopaths”

“I asked him why he’s so scared to commit and he said he’s not scared to commit, he’s just not in the mood to commit to me because he’s committed to himself, and I knew in that instant I wanted him more than I’ve ever wanted anything. I wanted to be with him, but I also wanted to be him, replace myself with him and find a girl like me who look at me like I looked at him when he said that.”



“I don’t think I ever told you about the night I fell down the ladder by the fire escape,
because I was drunk and sad after a fight with my mum, or my ex-boyfriend, I can’t remember,
but I fell down the ladder because I was drunk and sad and I injured my knee a little and when my ex-boyfriend asked about it I thought about using it against him, like blaming him for making me climb up the ladder so he would feel guilty and then love me a little more.
But that’s not how love works. I know that now but I didn’t back then.”



“Was this the stuff married life would be made of, two people making way for the confounding spectacle of the other, bewildered and slightly afraid?”



“The sharing of simple meals and discussing the day's events, of waking up together with plans for the future, things that feel practically bacchanalian when you're used to being on your own.”



“See? You're using the stoic glacier method."
"Remind me, what's the stoic glacier method?"
"It's the slow process of shaping someone's behavior by force of one's own personal stoicism.”



“Veblen, you may not know it now, but marriage affects everything that happens to you. Your mate becomes the mirror in which you see yourself. If he doesn't see you as a beautiful pearl, you'll wither.”



“According to Adolf Guggenbuhl-Craig, the Swiss analyst and author of
Marriage: Dead or Alive
, a wedding is more than a party or a legality. It's not less than a boxing ring, two people facing off, acknowledging their separate identities rather than their union, in the company of all the people who lay claim to them. A wedding is the time and place to recognize the full clutch of the past in the negotiation of a shared future.”



“This gossip did not mean that her servants were disloyal, but rather that they were proud of their mistress.”



“I sustain myself with the love of family. — Maya Angelou”



“A minute before, Christelle was complete; a minute later she feels that something will be missing from her for the rest of her life, that she is going to grow old in a world that witnessed the greatest love story and didn’t end. As she looks at her, Christelle has the marked feeling that she is going to lose someone she was meant to have. She opens her mouth to the air. It hurts to breathe—because it’s not her sadness that is growing but something else beating in her throat and ears; something that sounds like storm water runoff.”



“Abdul-Rahim has been so lonely trying to avoid stories about the past that Almira wonders whether she knows anything about him at all. She knows his tastes and habits, the cinnamon apple car air fresheners, the roll-on applicator for under-eye puffiness and the economy-size package of antihistamines, his lucky shirt, serious shirt, the birthday and funeral shirts, his illegible signature and small handwriting; but she has no idea how to talk to her father, how to outgrow his air of total secrecy.”



“Life is what happens when you’re wasting time holding a grudge against people who aren’t spending a single moment thinking of you. ”

“She may think she doesn't need anyone, but why fight through life alone when you can have backup.”



“Slowly, Azure began to understand that family was more than simply those whom you were born into. It was far more intrinsic and nuanced than that, and something within him vibrated with joy, as if he had unlocked or simply understood a key element of the puzzle that left a gaping hole of who he was.”



“I worry that intimacy and tenderness are becoming impossible ideals, rather than lived experiences. Surviving on this planet right now seems to be more about figuring out how to withstand being violated and exploited than it is about cultivating fulfilling relationships with ourselves, and with others.”



“Your opinion should be an opinion and not an attempt to change someone's opinion.”



“Every object looks different from different angles. Your eye level is not the only reality.”



“We have created a juvenile world. Here man-woman relationship is most sought after thing while finding God is so cheap that everybody is very sure about their philosophy or belief.”

“It wasn’t that I couldn’t get enough of him. Or that he was the best man I’d ever known. (I’d thought that was my dad, but now it was the dad from my favorite 2000s teen drama, Veronica Mars.) Or that he was my favorite person. (That was Shadi.) Or because he made me laugh so hard I wept. (He laughed easily, but rarely joked.) Or that when something bad happened, he was the first person I wanted to call. (He wasn’t.) It was that we met the same age my parents had, that the snowball fight and impromptu road trip had felt like fate, that my mother adored him. He fit so perfectly into the love story I’d imagined for myself that I mistook him for the love of my life.”



“You shouldn’t be married to an asshole, I guess. Probably no one should, except maybe other assholes.”



“Friendship or love don't need any reason.”

“...in the same way, just like being in love, being out of love also ends one day.”



“You're my soulmate. You feel familiar, like someone I have known since before. You are at the back of my mind always.”



“I was to be perennially torn this way without him. Now even more than earlier. Because earlier I didn't realize what being complete felt like. I didn't know that feeling until I lived it with him. But once I had felt it, things were never the same again. The lack of him was to be there always.”
